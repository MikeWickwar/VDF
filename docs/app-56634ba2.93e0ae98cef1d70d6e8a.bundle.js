The game offers some excellent odds for the player, which is why many players will head straight for the blackjack section of an online casino. When played correctly the casino has only a 1%  house advantage. By practicing the game and using some basic strategies, the house edge is only 0.5%, so knowledge is power and players who understand the game have much better opportunities to collect payouts when playing basic blackjack or some variations. Once you\'re ready, <a class="link" href="https://wizardofodds.com/play/blackjack/">click here to practice blackjack </a></p>\n      <h3>Blackjack Objective </h3>\n      <p>Ask Blackjack players what they believe is the primary objective of the game and they will tell you its to try to come close to 21 as possible. This however is not the true objective of the game. The ultimate goal in Blackjack is simply to beat the dealer. This can be done with many different hand values. It is possible to beat the dealer with a hand that is valued at just 13, making the 21 aspect not the true objective. Because the dealer can bust and must continue to draw cards up to a min of 17, players will often win with much lower hands. Remember  that the goal is to beat the dealer, either by having a higher valued hand that is below or equal to 21 or letting the dealer bust. </p>\n      <h3>Card Values </h3>\n      <p>There are different types of hands that are created when playing blackjack and players will use all of the cards in the deck. The main twist with blackjack is that the Ace can be worth 1 or 11, whichever will benefit the player most. All other cards are worth face value(number on card). Jack, Queen and King are worth 10 each. </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><em>Hard Hand</em>– When playing blackjack, players will hear the term Hard Hand. This means that the hand does not have to contain an Ace, but it can. The value of the ace will be 1 instead of being 1 or 11. </li>\n        <li><em>Soft Hand </em>- With a Soft Hand, the Ace can be 1 or 11 and players will have more chances to draw and beat the dealer. With a soft hand, the Ace will usually count as 11, so a hand with an Ace and a 5 is considered a soft 16. </li>\n\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Single Deck and Multiple Deck Blackjack Games </h3>\n      <p>Casinos offer different types of games and players will find blackjack games that use a single deck of cards and those that use multiple decks. Whenever possible, it is beneficial for players to choose a single deck game. The reason for this is that players will get more blackjack hands when playing with a single deck. It can also benefit those that count cards since it is easier to keep track of just 52 cards in play. Thats an advance tip VDF offers....card counting.With multi-deck games, players will see casinos using between 2 and 8 decks on most blackjack games. The number of decks used will vary based on the blackjack variation that is selected. 2 deck games are rare, but when players can find them, they are beneficial to play.</p>\n      <h3>The Play </h3>\n      <p>The game begins with placing a bet on the table, which can vary per casino. Always check the game minimum and maximum bet amount. Once bets are placed, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and two to himself, one face up and one face down. Based on the value of player cards, they can choose to do different things. The game choices are explained below and each of these options can be used to improve the odds of winning. </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li><em>Blackjack/21</em>– If players are dealt an Ace and a face card or a ten, they will immediately receive a payout as this is a blackjack. </li>\n        <li><em>Hit</em>– If players desire, they can hit and take an additional card to increase their hand value. This can be done as many times as needed. </li>\n        <li><em>Stand</em>– When players do not wish to make any more moves, they will choose to stand and their turn ends. </li>\n        <li><em>Double Down</em>– With the double down option, players will double their bet amount and take only one more card. </li>\n        <li><em>Insurance </em>– If the dealer card is an Ace, players can take Insurance. This is a side bet on whether the dealer has a blackjack. The bet offers even money in return, but there is a high house edge, <em>so players should avoid taking insurance. </em> </li>\n        <li><em>Surrender  </em>– The surrender option allows players to only risk half the bet amount. This is a good option when players are sure they will lose the hand.  </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>Using A Blackjack Strategy </h3>\n      <p>To benefit from the low house advantage and have the most success playing real money blackjack, players should learn and always use the basic Blackjack Strategy. While it can be difficult to memorize all actions, players will lower the house advantage by understanding this basic Strategy card, but you will not be able to reference it while playing at the casinos. </p>\n      <p>A basic strategy card will tell players when to hit, stand, double, split or surrender. Using this strategy will reduce the house edge to the lowest of 0.5% and will provide players with the best opportunities to win. </p>\n      <h5>Strategy Chart</h5>\n      <img class="img" src="'+n()(i)+'" alt="">\n      <h3><a class="link" href="#">Click here to learn a few advanced BlackJack Strategies </a></h3>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n';a.default=r},"Components/gambling/gambling101/craps101/craps101.html":function(e,a,t){t.r(a);var o=t(7091),n=t.n(o),s=new URL(t(3029),t.b),i=new URL(t(4990),t.b),r=new URL(t(6910),t.b),h='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+n()(s)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n    <div class="single-wide">\n      <h1>Craps 101</h1>\n      <img class="img" src="'+n()(i)+'" alt="">\n      <h1>Playing Craps </h1>\n      <p>It’s no hidden secret that the house always wins in casino games. This is the only way the casino can make enough money to pay their costs including staff, operations and maintenance etc. But in Craps in particular, the house edge can be very high compared to other games. The % of winning at Craps can be improved if you know the best way to play craps. </p>\n      <p>Some craps bets can have up to a 14% edge. This means if you play craps recklessly in a casino, without learning any craps strategy and how to win at craps, you’ll lose a lot of money in a short space of time. </p>\n      <p>By reading up our <a href="#">Craps strategy</a>, before you play craps in Vegas, you’ll minimize your losses (and maximize your chance to winning at craps) by sticking to profitable bets with a low house edge. You can avoid the costly bets that only suckers make, and in the long term you’ll increase your expected value from the game. You can also check out the various Craps Betting strategies which have been published online and used a lot by craps players. So let’s read and learn how to win at craps. When you have read this section and want to practice some craps here is a <a href="#">great place to play craps for free </a></p>\n      <p>The best bets to place,  whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, are the Pass Line bet and Don’t Pass Line bets.  These bets are similar to Blackjack and roulette in that you basically have a 50/50 chance of doubling up and the house only has a 1.41% advantage. </p>\n      <p>“Betting Against the Line” means you are betting against the run of play. These odds are actually slightly better than Pass Line bet as the house only has a 1.40% edge. You win by laying the person rolling and hoping that he hits a 7 before his Point. Be careful when placing this bet however, because it tends to mean you are betting against everyone else at the table i.e. when you win they lose. </p>\n      <p>The second range of optimal betting includes place 6, place 8, buy 4 and buy 10. Buying the 4 and 10 is cheaper than placing them. Just remember that placing the other numbers is cheaper than buying them. </p>\n      <p>Most players are unaware of this but there are a few bets you can make that have a 0% house advantage.  These are the Taking the odds and Laying the Odds.  Unfortunately, you need to have previously placed the minimum bet on Pass Line of Don’t Pass Line to place these, which happens to give the House a marginal advantage overall.  Most casinos also limit the amount you can wager on the odds bets.  This is related to your Pass Line/Don’t Pass bets limits typically 2-5x.(some up to 100x odds) </p>\n      <p>Take a look at our craps bets strategies for in-depth information about the best strategies. We also have to mention that we found some good strategy articles at <a href="www.casinosformoney.com">www.casinosformoney.com</a> for both craps and other casino games. </p>\n      <p>The worst thing you can do in Craps is make “Big Round”, Hard Way or Field bets.  Players who bet on individual numbers is typically the big money maker for casinos.  The odds can be even worse for Hard numbers like Hard Eight where the real odds of 10:1 are replaced by Casino odds of 9:1.  The worst proposition bets give the House a 16% advantage in some casinos.  Snake Eyes (1 and 1) is one of the most popular proposition bets but it is also costly. It gives the house a 14% advantage. </p>\n      <img src="https://www.dicecoach.com/images/dicedistr.png" alt="">\n      <p> In Craps you roll 2 dice with numbers 1-6 on both dice. The numbers facing up are tallied and outcomes can range from 2-12. The chart to the left shows the different ways each number can be rolled and the # of ways to roll that number. The 7 has the most possible ways to come up at 6. The 7 ends the game and starts a new one. Notice the 6 and the 8 both offer 5 ways to come up making them the next most popular.  numbers to come up an bet on.   </p>\n      <h2>Understanding Craps Odds </h2>\n      <p>For instance, odds can be related either as 2-1 or 2 to 1, where a 1 credit bet returns 2 credits. In other words, 2 to 1 odds returns the original 1 credit bet and a 1 credit profit. </p>\n      <h2>The Best Craps Bets </h2>\n      <p>The best bets in craps are the pass line bet, taking the odds, the don’t pass bar, the come bet, and placing a bet on the 6 or the 8 or both. Let’s look at each: </p>\n      <h4>Pass Line </h4>\n      <p>This is the most basic and popular of bets when playing Craps.  It has one of the lowest house edges (1.41%) and it is very simple to place. Betting on the pass line bet or betting “with the dice” is the most common bet in craps and you will see many players or shooters choosing it.</p>\n      <p>A pass line bet requires you to place chips on the “Pass Line” section of the table.  If the shooter’s come out roll is a 7 or 11, you win even money (1:1).  However, if the come out roll is 2,3 or 12 (craps)  you lose. </p>\n      <p>If any other number is rolled (4,5,6,8,9 or 10) it’s called the point.  The shooter continues to throw the dice until he/she roles a 7 or the Point. If the point is rolled first, you win even money.  If the 7 is rolled first you lose your bet.</p>\n      <p>Interestingly, in a game of Crapless Craps, the ability to lose a Pass Line bet to craps on a come out roll is removed – hence the name “crapless” craps.  This improves your odds of winning by removing the house edge and increasing your expected value. </p>\n      <h4>Don’t Pass Line</h4>\n      <p>You can also bet on the “Don’t Pass” line, which is basically when you are betting or laying the shooter on his first roll. This is simply the opposite of the pass line bet and is also known as betting against the dice. </p>\n      <p>To make this bet place your chips in the narrower section just beyond the pass line labelled don’t pass. </p>\n      <p>If the shooter rolls a 2 or 3 (Craps) than you win straight away (1:1 even money). If a 7 or 11 is rolled before the Point is scored you lose.  A 12 is considered a Push (draw) and normally you can relinquish this bet. </p>\n      <p>If any other number is rolled (4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10) this is established on the point number.  After this happens you’ll win your money back if a 7 is rolled before the Point number, and lose if a 7 comes first. </p>\n      <h4>Taking the Odds</h4>\n      <p>After the point has been established, you can make an additional bet known as Taking the Odds or Pass Odds.  You are betting on the Point number being rolled before a 7.  The pay out odds are normally displayed on the Casino craps table. </p>\n      <p>The odds vary for different numbers based on the likelihood of them being rolled. </p>\n      <h4>Normally, the payouts are as follows: </h4>\n      <ul>\n        <li>4 pays 2:1 </li>\n        <li>5 pays 3:2 </li>\n        <li>6 pays 8 pays 6:5 </li>\n        <li>9 pays 3:2 </li>\n        <li>10 pays 2:1 </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>The odds bet is the best bet you can make in the game of craps, because the house has no built-in advantage. Free odds bets are paid back at true odds, so when you’re making these bets the casino has no house edge whatsoever, it’s an even game!   </p>\n      <h4>Taking the Odds </h4>\n      <p>This is similar to the Come Bet and has the same odds above (Come Odds).  You can place this bet only after the point has been established.  If the 7 is rolled before the point, you lose.</p>\n      <h4>Laying the Odds </h4>\n      <p>Opposite of Taking the Odds.  This is a Don’t Pass Line bet which can be made only after the point has been established.  If a 7 is rolled before the point, you win.</p>\n      <h5>Laying the Odds Payout: </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>4 - 1:2</li>\n        <li>5 - 2:3</li>\n        <li>6 - 5:6</li>\n        <li>8 - 5:6</li>\n        <li>9 - 2:3</li>\n        <li>10 -1:2</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Come Bet </h4>\n      <p>This is similar to a Pass Line bet, but it is made after the point has been established (dealer button is ON).  The next roll then becomes the Come Out roll for your bet and establishes your Point.  The payout depends on the Point: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>7 or 11 pays 1:1 (also known as a Natural) </li>\n        <li>2, 3, or 12 you lose your money (also known as Craps) </li>\n        <li>If neither of the above is rolled then (4,5,6,8,9 or 10) becomes the point for your bet.  If a 7 comes before your point is rolled again you lose.  If your point is won however your payout depends on the Point.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h5>Come Bet Payouts: </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>4 - 2:1</li>\n        <li>5 - 3:2</li>\n        <li>6 - 6:5</li>\n        <li>8 - 6:5</li>\n        <li>9 - 3:2</li>\n        <li>10 -2:1</li>\n      </ul>\n      <hr>\n      <h4>Don’t Come Bet </h4>\n      <p>Oppose of Come Bet. This is similar to a Don’t Pass Line bet, but it is made after the Come Out roll. To make this bet all you need to do is to put your chips in the area labeled “Don’t Come” on the layout. You lose on a 7 or 11, and win on a 2 or 3. 12 is a “stand-off.” </p>\n      <p>Here you win if 7 rolls before your “come-point” is repeated, and lose if the “come-point” is made before a 7 is rolled. </p>\n      <h4>Place Bets </h4>\n      <p>You can bet on specific point numbers. If your number is rolled before a 7, you win.  If a 7 comes before your point number, you lose. You’re paid out according to the table below. </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>4 - 9:5</li>\n        <li>5 - 7:5</li>\n        <li>6 - 7:6</li>\n        <li>8 - 7:6</li>\n        <li>9 - 7:5</li>\n        <li>10 - 9:5</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Placing the 6 or 8 </h4>\n      <p>When you make a place bet you bet that one of the numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 will be hit before a 7 is hit. You can make a place bet any time by throwing your chips on the table while telling the dealer ‘I want to place the 6’ or whatever number you want to place your bet for.</p>\n      <p>So, if the number you bet on is rolled before a 7 you win and you are paid as follows: 4 or 10 placed – 9:5 odds, 5 or 9 placed – 7:5 odds, 6 or 8 placed – 7:6 odds. </p>\n      <p>As you can see the best for you is to place a bet on 6 or 8, because these bets have the best odds and also they have a good chance of hitting. </p>\n      <p>If you get the feeling like you want to place the 4 or 10, you should buy them instead, because although there is a Vig (a fee for winning bets) on these numbers, the edge comes out in your favor, however slightly. </p>\n      <p>However, the pass line bet is still the best one with the best odds and in the long run you should stick with it.</p>\n      <p>Although you can technically place a place bet at any time, it is impossible for it to come into effect until the shooters point is set, therefore it is more acceptable to ask for this bet after the come out roll is over. </p>\n      <h4>Big 6/Big 8 Bet </h4>\n      <p>This is a Bet on a Big 6 or Big 8, put down after the point has been established.  If a 6 or 8 is rolled before a 7, you win (1:1). This is a bet that you should not play because you can Place a bet on 6 or 8 and receive better odds. </p>\n      <h4>Field Bets </h4>\n      <p>Kind of what the name suggests, field bets are open to everyone who bets on the next number rolled.  To place one you simple throw your chips into the table (as little chips as possible) and tell the stick man what you want.  The payout for field bets: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>3, 4, 9, 10, and 11 all payout 1:1 </li>\n        <li>2 pays 2:1 </li>\n        <li>12 pays out either 2:1 or 3:1 (depending on the casino) </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Proposition Bets </h4>\n      <p>Placed before any throw. The house edge on all of these bets are over 11%. Therefore, you should not bet these very often or you should hedge your bets when you do so. </p>\n      <h5>You can bet on any number as follows: </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Betting on the next throw being a 2, 3 or 12 (Craps) </li>\n        <li>Any Seven: Betting on the next throw being a 7 </li>\n        <li>Eleven: Betting on the next throw being an 11 </li>\n        <li>Horn Bet: Betting on the next number being a 2, 3, 11, or 12. The payout is determined by the number rolled </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Proposition bets are those placed in the middle of the table layout, and those bets never have a good house edge. You should make these bets only for fun and to make your game more exciting. </p>\n      <h5>So, here they are: </h5>\n      <ul>\n        <li>With the “any seven” bet you’re betting the shooter will hit a 7 on the next roll. It has a horrible house edge of 16.67%. Never make this bet. </li>\n        <li>With the “snake eyes” bet you’re betting the shooter will throw a two on the next roll. </li>\n        <li>With the “yo eleven” bet you’re betting the shooter will hit an 11 on the next roll. </li>\n        <li>With the “any craps” bet you’re betting the shooter will throw a 2, 3, or 12 on the next roll. It holds a house edge of over 11% </li>\n        <li>With the “any three” bet you’re betting the shooter will throw a 3 on the next roll. </li>\n        <li>With the “midnight” bet you’re betting the shooter will throw a 12 on the next roll. </li>\n        <li>With the “horn” bet you’re combining the snake eyes, 3, yo 11, and midnight bets. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Hardway Bets </h4>\n      <p>A Hardway Bet is also made regarding the outcome of the next die throw. A Hardway roll occurs when doubles are thrown with an outcome of 4, 6, 8 or 10. </p>\n      <p>For example: rolling a pair of threes would produce a “hard 6”. An Easy roll is produced when the same outcome is achieved, but without rolling doubles. </p>\n      <p>For the previous example, rolling a 4 and a 2 would produce an “easy 6”. For a Hardway Bet to win, the shooter must roll a double with an outcome of 4, 6, 8 or 10. The wager loses if either a 7 or any Easy number is rolled. </p>\n      <h4>The Lay Bet </h4>\n      <p>The lay bet is almost similar with the don’t pass and don’t come bets, because with this bet your are playing against the dice. You can make this bet at any time in the game and it can be placed on 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10. A lay bet wins when 7 rolls before the number. </p>\n      <p>7 is more likely to come up than any other number so the casino requires you to wager more than you could win. This bet also requires a commission of 5% on average. If the bet is on 4 or 10 you get 1:2 odds, on 5 or 9 2:3 odds, on six or 8 5:6 odds. </p>\n      <h4>The Buy Bet </h4>\n      <p>When you choose this bet it means that you will buy numbers instead of placing them. </p>\n      <p>The numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 can all be bought but there are only two numbers that really make buy bets worthwhile and those numbers are 4 and 10 because they pay off better than the other numbers.

The best advice available for playing Roulette is to only play at a table that offers single zero.  This simply means that there is only one green zero instead of two or three.  Picking the correct table is the best advice you can get when considering the game of Roulette.   </p>\n      <p>The first thing to remember in basic roulette strategy is that you want to reduce the house’s edge as much as possible. To do this, you must stay away from double zero roulette tables. Always stick to single zero tables. Why? Because the house edge is slightly less on a single zero table than on an American double zero table. It is easy to understand why. When you bet on a number, let’s say number 1, on a single zero table, you have 36 numbers going against you (2-36 and single zero), giving you a 36-1 chance of your number coming up. However, when you bet on number 1 an American roulette table with the double zero, you have 37 numbers going against you (2-36, single zero and double zero), which gives you a 37-1 chance of your number coming up. But both bets pay out the same odds of 35-1. In short, you would be crazy to play an American Roulette table with a double zero if you had the option to play on a European Roulette table with a single zero only.</p>\n      <p><i><b>So the basic strategy for playing roulette is simply to maximize your chances against the house.</b></i></p>\n      <p>The only time VDF would suggest you play the game of roulette is with a matchplay coupon.  You must choose from the even money bets at Roulette when playing a matchplay.   These \'even money\' bets include betting on Even, Odd, Low (numbers 1 through 18), High (numbers 19 through 36), or Red or Black. All of these wagers pay out at 1 to 1.   With a matchplay coupon, you have a massive advantage over the house.  Simply play the exact amount of your matchplay coupon with the coupon on either red or black.  If the number comes in you will double your money, if the other color comes in (or green) you lose the amount you bet.  It really is that simple.  The house has a 2.7% advantage on a black/red bet on a single zero roulette table, but you will be paid 2 for 1 with a matchplay coupon.  This is a very easy, straight forward way to play a matchplay coupon with a massive advantage over the house.  </p>\n      <p>However, if you really want to play roulette, there is also a basic strategy you can employ once you decide to play at the European (single zero) Roulette table. There is nothing complicated about this method, nothing you have to really remember, which is why it is the ‘basic’ roulette strategy.  On any roulette table, there are two different kinds of bets that pay 2-1. You have the Dozens and you have the Columns. The Dozens are the first 12, second 12 and third 12 numbers on the table. The Columns are the first column of numbers, the second column of numbers and the third column of numbers on the inside of the roulette table. This basic strategy can be employed when betting on either of these selections.  The house has the advantage on all of these wagers and although these strategies might increase your time on the tables, we do not recommend using them.</p>\n      <p>The idea of this roulette basic strategy is to attempt to minimize your losses. So, place a bet of 1 unit on the first dozen (1-12) and 1 unit on the second dozen (13-24). So, if the ball lands on any number between 1 and 24, you win, and you make a profit of 1 unit, since the bet pays 2-1. If, however, the ball lands on a number between 25-36, or 0 (remember, never play on double zero to minimize your chances of beating the house), you lose. You can switch it around, betting on first dozen and third dozen, or second dozen and third dozen, as long as you keep your two bets on.  </p>\n      <p>This is far from a guarantee of winning. In fact, over a long period of time, your bankroll will start to whittle away due to the edge the house has. But you can gain short-term profits using this basic roulette strategy, as long as you do not deviate from it. What you must remember is that any betting system or strategy which claims to guarantee you a win at the game of roulette is not telling you the truth. Betting systems as designed to make your session more interesting, and give you short-term gains, but you cannot eliminate the house edge by using them – it is why casinos put the house edge in. As long as you remember that, you can take this basic strategy and tinker with it to create a betting strategy for roulette of your own. </p>\n      <img class="img" src="https://www.thesportingemporium.com/wp-content/uploads/roulette-wheel-s.jpg" alt="">\n      <h4>"My life experience has taught me nothing happens by chance.

The view I take is that the player wants to have a certain experience when he sits at a game and is willing to pay for that experience by means of the inevitable bite the house edge takes.   </p>\n      <p>To fully understand the product the player is purchasing requires a journey into the mathematics of casino games. Marketing must understand this material when developing effective strategies. Every part of a player’s interaction with a casino game has its own mathematics. Wagers have “odds” that determine how much to pay the player if he wins. The percentage of time the player wins is called the “hit frequency.” The “house edge” is the fraction of the player’s total initial wagers that the house expects to keep over the long run if the player uses perfect strategy. The “theo” or “theoretical” is the actual dollar amount the casino expects to win from the player. The “return to player” measures the fraction of the player’s total wagers the player is paid back in live casino play.</p>\n      <img src="'+n()(r)+'" alt="">\n      <h5>X-FOR-1, X-TO-1, 1-IN-X  </h5>\n      <p>Most table game wagers are paid in an "X-to-1" fashion. What this means is that if the player wins the round, his wager is returned and he is paid an additional amount for his win. If the player loses, then his wager is removed from the table. For example, if the player bets on red-7 straight-up in Roulette then the payout is 35-to-1. If his wager is $10, then he either wins $350 (35 × $10) and his $10 is returned, or he loses $10. This type of pay is different from slot machines. For slots, every time the player pushes the button or pulls the handle, an amount is deducted from his credit balance. That\'s his wager. Then the reels spin, and when they stop he is paid an amount based on the pattern displayed by the reels by reference to some pay table. No matter what the outcome of the reels, the player’s original wager is forfeited. We say that  slots are "X-for-1."  </p>\n      <h5>X-for-1</h5>\n      <p>     Most wagers on keno, lotteries, slots and video poker are paid "X-for-1.” This confusion has been used effectively, for example, in blackjack slot machines. Blackjack slots typically show a payout of 2 credits when the player is dealt a blackjack. The player knows that blackjack usually pays 3-to-2, so this seems like a sweet deal. However, this payout is 2-for-1. Thus the player forfeits his original 1 credit and then wins back 2 credits if he is dealt a blackjack. The player nets 1 credit in this way. Thus 2-for-1 is the same as 1-to-1. Few would play the table game of blackjack if the payout for a blackjack was reduced to 1-to-1, yet people often play these slots with a payout of 2-for-1. The progressive wager in Caribbean Stud is an example of an "X-for-1" wager appearing in a well known table game. The player\'s wager is automatically collected as it is made, and a light illuminates on the table indicating the player has made this wager. Another common "X-for-1" wager is the bad-beat jackpot in the poker room. The pot contributes $1 each hand to the progressive; that money is forfeit. </p>\n      <p>It is customary that wagers pay out "X-to-1” on a table game; examples of successful “X-for-1 wagers on table games are rare (one example are the hop bets in craps). Return the player\'s original wager if the player wins or pushes; otherwise collect the player\'s wager. Table games and slots are different animals and the most fundamental difference is that slots pay “X-for-1.” Some wagers in table games are very similar to slots. For example the Pair Plus wager in Three Card Poker has a straight pay table based on the three cards dealt to the player. It usually pays “1-to-1” for a pair, “3-to-1” for a flush, “6-to-1” for a straight, “30-to-1” for trips and “40-to-1” for a straight flush. This side bet could just as well be a slot, as it requires no strategy, but it would then have the rather strange looking pay table: “2, 4, 7, 31, 41.” </p>\n      <h5>1-in-X  </h5>\n      <p> Finally, the terminology "1-in-X" is commonly used, but not in the context of payouts. For example, in craps, the shooter will get a 7 (over the long run) 1-in-6 rolls. In double-0 Roulette, the number red-7 will come up (over the long run) 1-in-38 spins. The player is dealt a blackjack (over the long run) approximately 1-in-21 hands. The terminology “1-in-X” has nothing to do with how much a game pays for a winning wager. It is used to describe the rate of occurrence of an event at a table game. </p>\n      <h3>HIT FREQUENCY  </h3>\n      <p>The concept of "hit frequency" is best applied to games that pay “X-for-1” like keno, lotteries, slots and video poker. It is a little fuzzier when applied to table games, especially those with a strategy or multiple wagering opportunities. </p>\n      <p>If the player is playing keno, the lottery, slots or video poker then the player makes a bet (say $1). That $1 is forfeit. It\'s gone. Now the only question is if he will get something back after the round has resolved. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. In the real world, nothing is exact. But to the mathematician analyzing these games, they can determine very exact numbers. We’ll use Keno as an example.  Suppose you are playing Keno and you mark 10 spots on a card with 80 spots. Suppose 20 balls are dropped in the Keno game. This is all very standard, exactly how Keno usually works in many casinos.  Now suppose the pay table for Keno awards some money back if you hit 3 or more of the 10 spots you marked. You always lose your original bet. It\'s gone. The question is if you get to collect anything at the end of the ball drop. It\'s time for decimals and percents. Don\'t ask me how I figured it out, but for this exact situation the hit frequency (probability of 3 or more hits) is 47.94%, or 0.4794. If we modify the Keno pay table so that it pays back only when you hit 4 or more of the 10 spots you marked, then the hit frequency is 21.20%, or 0.2120. If we have a payout any time 2 or more of the 10 spots are hit, then the hit frequency is 77.46%, or 0.7746.. </p>\n      <p>For the Pair Plus wager, the number 25.61% is an exact number. The hit frequency is a theoretical number; it is computed by a mathematician. In practice, it gives a good sense for how the game will perform on the floor, but the game’s actual performance has nothing to do with determining the hit frequency. The hit frequency gives a sense of how often a player is going to get something back on his wager. Obviously a player wants to win as often as possible, so from the player’s perspective a high hit frequency is a good thing. Naturally, the player also wants high payouts. These two desires act against each other: giving the player everything he wants is impossible. A game that has a low hit frequency with high payouts may frustrate the player because he seems to lose and lose while waiting for a combination to occur that seems ever more unlikely. A game that has a high hit frequency with low payouts may frustrate the player because he feels like he is going nowhere fast; it becomes obvious how the house is making its money. The answer is always somewhere in between.  </p>\n      <p><b>Here are two lottery games to illustrate these psychological points. A low hit frequency, high payout lottery and a high hit frequency, low payout lottery. We’ve designed these as extreme examples just to drive home the point about how this feels from the player’s perspective. </b></p>\n      <p>Suppose we’ve been given the task of creating a lottery with one million tickets; the cost of each ticket is one dollar. We know that if we sell every ticket, then we will take in $1,000,000 gross income. We are directed to return $900,000 in cash prizes, leaving a net profit of $100,000. We consider two prize schemes. </p>\n      <h3>EXAMPLE: LOTTERY 1 (LOW HIT FREQUENCY, HIGH PAYOUT): </h3>\n      <p>One million tickets are produced. Each costs $1 to play. Out of these 1 million tickets, suppose exactly 9 of them pay 100,000-for-1 and the others lose. That is, 9 of them say "You win $100,000!" and the other 999,991 of them say "Please play again!” The player will consider the $1 purchase of the ticket measured against the possibility of winning $100,000. <b>In this case the hit frequency is 9/1,000,000 = 0.0009%.</b> </p>\n      <h3>EXAMPLE: LOTTERY 2 (HIGH HIT FREQUENCY, LOW PAYOUT): </h3>\n      <p>One million tickets are produced. Each costs $1 to play. Out of these 1 million tickets, suppose exactly 900,000 pay 1-for-1 and the others lose. That is, 900,000 of them say "You win $1!" and the other 100,000 say "Please play again!" The player will consider the $1 purchase of a ticket measured against the possibility of winning $1 <b>In this case the hit frequency is 900,000/1,000,000 = 90.00%.</b></p>\n      <p>It is easy to see that each lottery makes the same amount of profit if every ticket is sold. Lottery players like the opportunity to win big, so lottery 1 is more likely to succeed in the marketplace. But if lottery 1 was a casino game player after player would lose his entire buy-in a matter of minutes (even playing just $1 per round). A few players would win big eventually, but that would be extremely rare. The game would die soon after it was put on the floor. If a casino game was designed in lottery 2 style, players might play for the entertainment and free drinks, but that game too would not last long. Players of lottery 2 have no chance to ever get ahead of the game. </p>\n      <p>Hit frequencies, as described above, are precisely defined for keno, lotteries, slots and video Poker. This term also has this meaning for certain wagers that pay for a specific hand or event at a table game. As we saw above, it makes sense to discuss the hit frequency for the Pair Plus wager inThree card Poker. What does “hit frequency” mean for a more complicated wager involving strategy at a table game? </p>\n      <p>Suppose you are  playing Blackjack. You place a $10 bet and are dealt 8-8 against the dealer\'s 6. You split and re-split to four hands. You double on three of the four splits. You put out a total of $70 on the hand. A lot of other stuff happens and you look down at the end of what you’ve been paid. Either there is more than $70 in front of you, less than $70, or you managed to get a big push and have $70 returned to you. What does "hit frequency" mean in a situation like this? Honestly, I have no idea. No matter how ill-defined, hit frequency has become part of the vernacular of table games. Some features of games have hit frequencies that can be computed. In many cases, hit frequency just doesn\'t make sense according to the formal definition. </p>\n      <h2>WHATS THE HOUSE ADVANTAGE? </h2>\n      <img src="'+n()(h)+'" alt="">\n      <p>Figure 1 indicates the house Advantage (or “house Edge,” or “H/A”) for some well known games. The house advantage is commonly understood as the percentage of total initial player wagers the casino expects to earn over the long run if all players use perfect strategy against the game. For those games that have exactly one wagering opportunity, the house advantage refers to the advantage for that wager. This is the case with the percent\'s given for Casino War, and roulette, as well as keno, slots and video poker games. If a table game has a main game and a side bet, then it is usually the house advantage of the main game that is quoted as the house advantage for the overall game. For example, Three Card Poker has both the Ante/Play and the Pair Plus wagers; the stated house advantage is for the main game, the Ante/Play bet. Blackjack and craps also have more than one wagering opportunity  </p>\n      <h3>BLACKJACK HOUSE ADVANTAGE            </h3>\n      <p>The house advantage for Blackjack is based on the specific rules for the game played; it is not a number that is valid for all blackjack games. For the percent presented in Figure 1, blackjack is played with 8 decks, the dealer stands on soft 17, the player can split twice (up to three hands) and double after a split. Split aces receive one card each, and the player cannot surrender.  Blackjack actually has a second wagering opportunity that very few players use and it is not considered on the house advantage. Players, dealers and casino management don’t think about insurance properly; insurance is a separate wagering opportunity in blackjack that is independent of the main bet. It is a side bet. It is a wager that is available to the player any time the dealer shows an Ace. The player is paid 2-to- 1 on the wager if the dealer has a face card under the Ace, otherwise the player loses. There is no theoretical link between the main bet and the insurance bet. The house advantagefor the insurance wager on an 8 deck game is 7.47%. </p>\n      <h3>CRAPS HOUSE ADVANTAGE     </h3>\n      <p>For <a href="#">craps</a> it is not possible to give an overall house advantage. Craps is a hodge-podge of wagers, some good and some bad. If we focus on one wager then we can indicate the house advantage. The pass line wager has a house advantage of 1.41% and that’s what is included in Figure 1. The “Any Craps” wager has a house advantage of 11.11% </p>\n      <h3>CARD POKER HOUSE ADVANTAGE    </h3>\n      <p>For Three card Poker there are two wagers: the Ante/Play bet and the Pair Plus bet. The Ante/Play bet has a house advantage of 3.37% (using the 1-4-5 bonus pay table) and the Pair Plus bet has a house advantage of 7.28% (using the 1-3-6-30-40 pay table). For some games, the player has to play perfect basic strategy to get the house advantage . For example, blackjack, Let it Ride, Pai Gow Poker, and Three Card Poker all are games with a player strategy. Casino War, craps and roulette have no player strategy, so the house advantage is inescapably the long-run experience the players will have. Any variations in this experience are simply expressions of the volatility. </p>\n      <p>Note that even if a strategy is trivial, there will still be player errors. In Three Card Poker, the correct strategy is to raise with Q-6-4 off-suit or higher and to fold all other hands. The strategies for blackjack, Let it Ride and Pai Gow Poker are complex. The more complicated the strategy, the more errors the players will make. Some errors are very costly on simple games. Error rates translate to returns to the casino higher than the “theoretical win” predicted by the house advantage . </p>\n      <h3>SLOTS HOUSE ADVANTAGE & VIDEO POKER HOUSE EDGE   </h3>\n      <p>For slots and video poker, the house advantage is also called the “hold” of the game. The use of the word “hold” as a synonym for house advantage causes great confusion. The word “hold” has an entirely different meaning for table games, to be discussed later. The house advantage for each slot is set by the casino by referencing several optional pay tables supplied with the slot. Pay tables and other features of a slot are created by a mathematician who analyzed the game and built a spreadsheet for the slot machine, called a PARS sheet (PARS = “Pay Table and Reel Strip). A PARS shows the game manufacture how to create the machine by indicating exactly how each reel strip is set up and how much each combination pays when it is hit. A common misconception is that somehow slots are set up to be hot or cold at certain times. In fact, each location on each reel is equally likely to occur on each spin, and this doesn’t change. The changes are set in advance by engineering the design of the reels and the payouts for combinations. </p>\n      <p>Typically a casino can choose from a menu of possibilities and get a house advantage for a slot anywhere from 2% to 20%. Slots that have a house advantage under 4% are called “loose.” Slots that have a house advantage of 8% or higher are often referred to as “tight.” For video poker games, the game is dealt with a single deck of cards. By law, the deal of these cards must behave statistically in every way just like the game as dealt live. There can be no weighting of the cards or other deviations. Each card must be equally likely to be dealt any time it remains on the deck. Video Poker comes in a wide variety of versions. The most common and most popular variants are Jacks or Better, Bonus, Double Bonus, Deuces Wild, and Joker Poker. In each case the house advantage is determined by the payouts for various poker hands. </p>\n      <p>For example, playing Jacks or Better, there is a payout for any final poker hand that consists of a pair of Jacks or higher. Figure 2 gives the pay table that knowledgeable video poker players seek out. The player must play 5 credits to get the listed payouts. Note that these payouts are “for-1.” The player’s credits are deducted from his total before the hand begins. For those who wager less than “max coin” the player receives a lower payout for a Royal Flush, typically 250 instead of 800. The house advantage for this pay table is 0.46%, based on the player playing perfect strategy. A perfect strategy is quite complicated and all but a few experts play a considerably worse game. In practice, a house advantage of about 1% is earned by the casino. This pay table is referred to as Jacks or Better “9/6,” with the 9/6 referring to the payouts for a Full House (9) and Flush (6). The most common pay table for Jacks or Better is 8/5, which has a house advantage of 2.70% playing perfect Jacks or Better Strategy. At some casinos you will see a 7/5 (house advantage = 3.85%) or even a 6/5 (house advantage = 5.00%) pay table for Jacks or Better. I have never seen a pay table tighter than 6/5.  </p>\n      <p>For most video poker games, pay tables exist that have close to a 0% break even house edge, or in some cases, have a slight player edge. For example, 10/6 Jacks or Better (player edge = 0.70%) can occasionally be found. Such video poker games are offered at a low denomination and may be placed close to the front of the casino, as a loss leader. In some cases, professional players will target video poker games that offer these great odds. It should be clear that if a casino is using a “cash back for points” marketing system, together with offering a video poker game with a break-even house edge, the expert player will turn the house edge well in his favor.  The house advantage is an exact number that can be worked out precisely for most games. For many games, the advantage can be determined by using a spreadsheet. For some games, the house advantage is determined by doing an exhaustive analysis of every possible combination that can occur in the game. This may require extensive spreadsheet analysis. Typically the mathematics for slot machines is done this way. The analysis may require a computer to go through each combination of events, work out the proper strategy for that combination, and keep track of the overall results. This is commonly referred to as “running a cycle.” Video poker is analyzed by running a cycle.  </p>\n      <p>Whenever possible, the house advantage is obtained by a complete spreadsheet analysis or by running a cycle (or both, just to be sure). A computer simulation is often used to confirm the exact theoretical results. For a few games, the toughest games, the rules and strategy are so complex that the house advantage can only be approximately determined by computer simulation. Once the casino knows the house advantage, they will have a sense for how much money they can make from the game based on the total wagers. But, the house advantage tells other stories as well. If the house advantageis too close to 0%, then the casino won’t make enough money from the game. If the house advantage is too high, then players will lose their money too fast and abandon the game, and once again the casino won’t make enough money from the game. The house advantage is another balancing act, just like the “hit frequency” and “payout” dilemma described in the lottery examples. The house advantage has to be low enough to make players want to play the game and high enough so that the casino earns a reasonable amount of profit from the game. The standard table games consisting of baccarat, blackjack and craps, all offer wagers with a house advantage under 1.5%. There are very few table games that make it into a casino with a house advantage under 1.5% and those that do are mostly blackjack variants. Well known examples are Spanish 21, Super Fun 21, and Blackjack Switch. For example, with liberal rules and perfect play, Blackjack Switch has a house advantage under 0.20%. In practice, due to player errors, Blackjack Switch often returns in excess of 3%. Spanish 21 and Super Fun 21 also have huge error rates. Blackjack variants also move very quickly, generating many more decisions per hour than other games, making the games affordable for the casino. </p>\n      <h3>ROULETTE HOUSE ADVANTAGE  </h3>\n      <p>Likewise, for table games, the advantage can be over 5%, but the game better move very slowly and have a compelling reason to play. Otherwise, a house advantage over 5% is likely to burn players out too fast. The game Mississippi Stud has a house advantage close to 5% and a huge error rate. It is relatively new and popular in some markets, but does not seem to be catching hold. Caribbean Stud has a house advantage over 5.2% and has been steadily advantage losing market share for years.  Roulette maintains its popularity, even though every wager at roulette has a fixed house advantage of 5.26%. The house advantage can easily be computed by hand as follows. First note that without the 0 and 00 spots on the wheel, the payouts for roulette are designed to be absolutely fair based on a wheel with 36 spots: a 0.00% house advantage. By putting both 0 and 00 on the wheel, there are two bad spots on the wheel out of 38 total spots. So, for double-0 roulette, the house advantage is 2/38 = 5.26%. For single-0 roulette, the advantage is 1/37 = 2.70%.  It is not quite true that every roulette wager has the same house advantage ; there is an exception that we note. Double 0-roulette sometimes offers a wager called “first 5” that pays 6-to-1. This wins if any of 0, 00, 1, 2, or 3 hits. It loses if any other number is hit. The house advantage for this wager is 3/38 = 7.89%. The great majority of roulette players know better than to take this bet, just as most blackjack players know to never take insurance. For games with side bets, it is usually the case that the main game has a lower house advantage than the side bet. Moreover, the lower the advantage on the main game, the higher the house advantage on the side bet. Side bets do not have the same practical limitations in the size of their payouts or house advantage as the main bet. A 3% edge on the main game can easily go with a 7% house advantage on the side bet, for example. </p>\n      <p>As an example, consider the Pair Plus bet on Three Card Poker. The main game in Three Card Poker (with the standard 1-4-5 bonus table) has house advantage 3.37%. Shuffle Master includes pay tables for the Pair Plus with house advantagesvarying from 2.32% to 7.28%. When Three Card Poker was first introduced, the 2.32% version of Pair Plus was most common. Now the 7.28% version is the main one used. There is logic to this increase; from the casino’s side they earn a lot more from a well established and loyal player base; from the player’s side the change is just “cosmetic” and they don’t notice it. </p>\n      <img class="img" src="https://vegasdealfinder.com/resources/Pictures/man-and-blackboards2.png" alt="">\n      <h3>Mathematics has beauty and romance.

We suggest you start with Jacks or Better, pick the denomination you want to risk (.05, .25, $1.00, $5,... ), choose how many coins to play (generally from 1 to 5 coins), Press deal and the machine gives you five cards, you choose which to hold and which to discard, the machine replaces your discards and pays you off according to the value of your hand. </p>\n      <p>You may have heard the adage that the "house always has the advantage." Video poker is an exception to that rule. If you look for the most liberal pay tables, and play them properly, you can have a tiny thin advantage. Some pay tables, which are slightly in the machine\'s favor, can return over 100%, if you factor in incentives such as free drinks, cash back, free play, mailers, and other comps. <a href="https://www.videopokertrainer.org/">Here is a great place to practice Video Poker online</a></p>\n      <h3>Rules </h3>\n      <h5>Following are the rules for standard video poker: </h5>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Most video poker games are played with a standard 52-card deck. Obviously, joker wild games will include one or more jokers in the deck. </li>\n        <li>After making a wager and press the "deal" button the game will randomly give the player five cards from the deck. </li>\n        <li>The player chooses which cards to throw away and which ones to keep. </li>\n        <li>The game replaces the discarded cards with randomly chosen cards from the remaining deck. </li>\n        <li>The player is paid according to the poker value of his hand and the posted pay table. </li>\n      </ol>\n      <h3>How Much To Bet </h3>\n      <p>  The majority of machines give you the option to play between one and five coins per game. You should always play five coins. Why? There is always a bonus for playing five coins per game on the royal flush. See the table below.   </p>\n      <table width="518" style="font-size: 16px;" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4">\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <td width="143" style="background-color:

4000 coins per coin bet. You will also notice that the theoretical return percentage is also greatly improved when betting max. If you find that playing max coins is too expensive then look for a machine with a lower coin denomination.  For example, if you don\'t want to risk $1.25 per hand playing 5 coins at .25, then consider playing 5 coins at .05 a hand.  The payouts for a big hand with 5 coins played help reduce the house advantage.</p>\n      <h5><a href="#">Click here for a few VDF Video Poker Strategies </a></h5>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n';a.default=r}}]);
