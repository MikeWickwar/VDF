class="triple-wide">\n      <div class="first-container">\n        <h4>PRO TIP: Getting from the airport to your hotel</h4>\n        <p>With so much excitement and energy where arriving in Vegas it can be easy to just jump in a cab and head to your hotel. But that\'s actually the worst option for transportation. For only $2 you can ride the WAX bus (depending on my departure point – more on this further down). As per the shuttles, which are frequent and operate through the night, they still provide a great & affordable option if you traveled solo or with just one other person; if I travel in group of 4 or 5 people a large Uber may be a cheaper option.  Besides the WAX bus, for one or two people the shuttle provides an affordable alternative to the ever-increasing taxi fares (with ever-increasing starting fixed rate, which is simply a rip-off – and of course the expectation of a large tip, not sure why to this date, unlike pretty much any other cab service in the rest of the world). These shuttles will take you to any main resort, even off the Strip, and they are very important for those not wanting to be ripped off by taxis the second they arrive in Las Vegas. Don\'t ride in taxis ever when in Vegas. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="'+o()(s)+'" alt="">\n        <h4>SIGHT SEEING! TAKE LOTS OF PIC\'S!</h4>\n        <p>Vegas was built with the hard earned money of its visitors. It stunning & impressive architecture leaves endless opportunities for great pictures.  Make memories while in Vegas with pictures. Put the phone to some additional use and gather the crew for some of the best pictures. Visit Binions Casino on Fremont St for a Free picture with a million Dollars. </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class="second-container">\n        <h4>TIPS FOR FINDING THE CHEAPEST FLIGHTS TO LAS VEGAS</h4>\n        <p>When flying to Las Vegas you will most likely be flying to McCarran International Airport (LAS). When you land, you\'re only 10 minutes away from The Strip.</p>\n        <p>Because Las Vegas is the 19th busiest airport in the world, it\'s served by many domestic and international carriers. There can be more price competition which means flying to Vegas can be more affordable than other less-traveled destinations.</p>\n        <p>\n            How much you pay for your flight depends on several factors:\n            <li>Flying distance</li>\n            <li>Airline </li>\n            <li>Your travel dates </li>\n            Short-Haul Flights Are Almost Always Cheaper\n        </p>\n        <p>Obviously, flying from faraway destinations are going to be more expensive than if you fly from California. This isn\'t always true, but you can usually find roundtrip flights for $150 or less from the U.S. west coast compared to $250 from the East Coast. </p>\n        <p>You might consider using your frequent flyer miles for cross-country flights as you can get more value from each point. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="'+o()(l)+"\" alt=\"\">\n\n        <h4>Fly Discount Airlines </h4>\n        <p>What airline you fly also makes a difference. Going with a \"no frills\" discount airline is almost always going to be your cheapest option compared to flying one of the major carriers. But, don't forget to factor in your carry-on and checked bags into the final price if you fly on a discount airline. The lowest rate usually only lets you grab a seat and bring a small personal item onboard. </p>\n        <h4>Check Your Travel Dates </h4>\n        <p>Some days of the week are more expensive to fly than others. The flight search engines like Google Flights and Momondo make it easy to quickly spot the price trends. If you have some flexibility with your travel days, use the travel search engine price graphs to quickly book the same route for less. </p>\n        <h4>Avoid the Summer Months </h4>\n        <p>If you don't have a preference when you go to Vegas, the cheapest months to fly are typically January and February. You'll escape the brutal summer heat where the average daily high is above 100 degrees and you'll avoid the most expensive flights to Las Vegas. </p>\n        <h4>The Cheapest Airlines to Las Vegas </h4>\n        <p>The best airline may boil down to where you're flying from. If you live near a hub for one of these airlines, you're in luck! </p>\n        <h5>Southwest Airlines </h5>\n        <p>Southwest Airlines has a large hub in Terminal 1 of McCarran Airport. Maybe you've even connected through Vegas on a prior Southwest flight. There are multiple flight options and you can save some cash as your first two checked bags fly free!Southwest Airlines is also a Chase Ultimate Rewards transfer partner. If you own a Sapphire product or a Chase business credit card, you can transfer your points on a 1:1 basis for your business or personal travel. </p>\n        <h5>JetBlue </h5>\n        <p>JetBlue can be a better option if you're looking for a discount airline from the U.S. East Coast. But you shouldn't neglect their West Coast routes either from Seattle, San Francisco, or Long Beach. You can find fares for $40 per person on JetBlue in their \"Blue\" class. You can bring on one carry-on and personal item for free, but you will have to pay for each checked bag. Additional in-cabin perks can also include free snacks and beverage and free Fly-Fi internet. Don't forget that JetBlue is also a transfer partner for the American Express Membership Rewards points. </p>\n        <h5>Frontier Airlines </h5>\n        <p>It's very common to find bargain-priced flights to Las Vegas on Frontier Airlines. One of the travel sweet spots is non-stop service from San Jose, CA. You can get a roundtrip flight for only $77. The only catch is that your carry-on bag costs $30 each way ($60 roundtrip) and checked bags cost $25 each way. </p>\n        <h5>Allegiant Air </h5>\n        <p>If you can't fly JetBlue or Southwest, Allegiant is another popular discount airline to consider. The service quality is still along the same lines as Frontier Airlines. Carry-on bags cost approximately $20 to bring onboard and a checked bag costs $45. Allegiant can still be a viable option if it's cheaper to fly than a major U.S. carrier. </p>\n        <h5>Alaska Airlines </h5>\n        <p>From the U.S. West Coast, you can also see if Alaska Airlines has any discount seats available. A one-way flight costs between $45 and $89 depending on the departure city. As even some of the discount airlines can charge more than $100 for a flight from the same departure city, it's worth price shopping. With these fares, you're allowed one carry-on bag. Your first and second checked bags cost $25 each. </p>\n        <h5>Flying with a Major Carrier </h5>\n        <p>You can also fly American, Delta, or United to Las Vegas. Their fare prices are typically more than the discount carriers, but you can still find affordable options. To avoid paying cash, you might decide to redeem your frequent flyer miles. </p>\n        <p>On American, flights shorter than 500 miles cost 7,500 miles each way. Longer flights in economy cost 12,500 miles each way. </p>\n        <p>United award flights start at 10,000 miles for flights 700 miles or less and cost 12,500 miles for long-haul domestic flights. </p>\n        <p>Delta award flights use a variable price pricing model, but you can begin redeeming Delta SkyMiles for 5,000 miles for short haul flights. If you want to pay with points, Delta might be the most economical option for you. </p>\n        <h5>Summary on Finding Flights to Las Vegas </h5>\n        <p>The cheapest flights to Las Vegas are almost always going to originate from the U.S. West Coast on a discount airline. But, you can still find bargains with any airline if you compare prices online regardless of your departure city. Because so many airlines fly to Las Vegas, finding a bargain can be easier than you think. </p>\n        <h4>Plan Your Trip today with our help at VDF!</h4>\n        <p>Start planning today with our help.

Allow yourself to be flexible but this gives you a great map to make sure you see everything you want to. </p>\n        <h4>Can you travel with Alcohol?</h4>\n        <p>Alcohol is looked on no differently then other liquids. They must be is a 3.2oz size or smaller. So bringing a nice selection of your favorite Airplane bottle sized cocktails is a great way to save money.

The rooms are spacious and well equipped The gaming floor is active and well managed. The first floor offers a very lively upbeat vibe while the second floor is more low key. This affords you the location option depending on your mood. The Keno area on the second floor is a great place to have a drink and try your luck. Drink service is plentiful and available. The D grill offers a large menu with good quality service and food. Overall The D is a great place to stay , gamble, and enjoy the Downtown atmosphere. I highly recommend The D for your Vegas trip. It is my choice and had been for many years because the facility in all respects is consistently excellent". - Jerry and Sally Loy - Binghamton, NY </p>\n        <p>"Great Casino" - Oct 16, 2019</p>\n        <p>Dealers were all fun & glad to help the newbies. Lower limits than strip. We played $5 roulette for over an hour & went back the next night too. Drink servers were quick & friendly.\n          Ladies dancing in the middle of the tables were very tasteful & added to the amazing atmosphere. We had a great time! - Julie D - NY, NY </p>\n        <p>"Love this Place!!" - Oct 4, 2019</p>\n        <p>This is my favorite casino in Vegas!  I used to love it when it was the Fitz but I love it more now!  What I used to love, the big bathroom with the big counter, the fun old school slot machines, and the fun atmosphere were all improved on when Derek and his brother took over. </p>\n        <p>They took out the over worked tubs and put in modern stand in showers.  I really like how the lighting in the bathroom is behind the mirror but still lights the room well.  </p>\n        <p>Also, the beds are all new and so comfy.  Everything is updated in the rooms though if the TV isn\'t working, don\'t be afraid to call the front desk.  They can fix it in an instant.  Pro tip:  If you want a quiet night, especially if you\'re going to bed before midnight, ask for a room higher up. </p>\n        <p>I love the second floor or as they call it Vintage Vegas.  The video poker is awesome, even at the bar.  Oh, and the bartenders are the nicest, most fun bartenders in all of Vegas!  You\'ll want to get some quarters to play the Sigma Derby which always has a crowd.  Something about this game makes everyone talk like a 1930\'s gangster.  It\'s so fun! The first floor has all the modern slot machines and great table games.  I really thought the dancing dealers were going to be sleazy and make me uncomfortable but the music is great and I usually dance at the table with them.  Plus, they\'re super nice ladies!  If you\'re looking for a fun, comfortable place to stay, this is your spot! - Candice P.

Even within one big casino hotel, you can log 10,000 steps from your room to the restaurants and casino throughout the day without ever going outside. </p>\n        <h3>Walking the Strip</h3>\n        <p>If your feeling crazy and want to try walking the length of the strip be prepared. although it never appears to be that far away, Vegas casinos are huge and the walk is always longer then it looks. Its approx. 4.2 miles from one end of the strip to the other. It takes approx. 75 minutes to walk from one end to the other.  </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n';a.default=s},"components/topDeals/packing/packing.html":function(e,a,t){t.r(a);var n=t(4385),o=t.n(n),i=new URL(t(1944),t.b),r=new URL(t(8897),t.b),s='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+o()(i)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="triple-wide">\n    <div class="first-container">\n      <h4>Pro Tip:</h4>\n      <p>Packing a suitcase may seem like a straightforward task—but do it wrong, and you could end up losing valuables, paying overweight baggage fees, or cleaning up messy spills. That’s why it’s vital to learn how to pack a suitcase the smart way. </p>\n      <p>Once you’ve laid out everything you need, start with the heaviest items first. You’ll want to put them toward the bottom of the suitcase when it’s standing (i.e., the side with the wheels) so it won’t be too top-heavy. Distribute heavier items evenly between both sides of the suitcase so it won’t be pulled off-balance when it’s standing. </p>\n      <p>When packing shoes, don’t let any space go to waste: Fill them with socks, undergarments, or other small items. If they’re dirty, pack the shoes in a plastic bag or put a shower cap over the soles to protect the rest of your bag. </p>\n      <p>Some travelers swear by rolling clothes; others prefer to fold. But the best way to pack a suitcase is often a mix of the two. Wrinkle-prone items tend to come out in better shape if you fold them, but tightly rolled clothes are easier to work into the little nooks and crannies around your bag. My own strategy is to put my shoes in the bottom half of my suitcase, fill the top half with rolled clothing, and then fold bulky items like sweatshirts or rain jackets and lay them on top of everything else. </p>\n      <h4>Hoover Dam</h4>\n      <p>The Hoover Dam is located in the desert and temperatures will usually be hotter than 100 degrees (F) in the summer. It was 90 degrees (F) on our last visit in late March. </p>\n      <p>Bring plenty of drinking water with you, especially if you plan to drive and park on the Arizona side. You\'ll be walking uphill on the way back to your car. The walk across the dam is a half-mile, round trip. </p>\n      <p>Wear sunscreen and sun hats on the dam. There will be little to no shade. </p>\n      <p>I recommend bringing your own snacks and picnic. The cafe at Hoover Dam serves lunch, bottled water and cold treats as well. </p>\n      <h4>POOL PARTY KEEP IT COVERED...AT FIRST</h4>\n      <p>Getting to the pool party usually means walking in through a casino where Grandma\'s playing Wheel of Fortune slots or Grandpa is trying his luck at blackjack. All-day clubs require patrons to wear resort-appropriate dress when heading to or from the pool party. Men should wear board shorts and a collared resort-wear-type shirt such as a polo shirt or Hawaiian shirt. Some day clubs allow nice T-shirts if they don\'t have offensive print. Women should wear a swimsuit cover-up such as a sundress, a nice top and shorts or other modest attire that meets the establishment\'s general dress code. Once you\'re out in the pool area, you can strip down to your swimwear. </p>\n      </div>\n    <div class="second-container">\n      <h2>PACKING FOR VEGAS</h2>\n      <p>So the time has come to pack for your big trip to Las Vegas. But what should I bring? Las Vegas is hot in the summer, warm in the Spring and Fall and cool in the winter. Its always best to check the weather forecast before you leave and pack accordingly. Using luggage that has wheels so you can easily transport is highly recommended. Overpacking for Las Vegas is very common. </p>\n      <p>Packing in advance reduces your chances of forgetting something and allows you time to purchase stuff you still need.  Pack only what you need. Most people over pack. For the most part, casual clothes are worn morning, noon and even at night in Las Vegas ...although many like to really step up their game in the evening. Dressing up to hit the town. But for casual attire that means slacks (black, brown, blue or khaki); linen or cotton in the Spring and Summer, wool/wool blend or polyester for Fall/Winter. Skirts and tops for the women. Pack a shirt or blouse for each day or your trip  Include at least one nice dressy outfit (cocktail dress or a dinner jacket) for going to a gourmet restaurant or night club. This is Vegas so go for it!  </p>\n      <p>Bring a pair of underwear and socks for each day. Pajamas or oversized T-shirts work great for sleeping. Placing rolled up socks and other soft clothing items inside shoes will save space and help the shoes keep their shape. </p>\n      <p>Take two-three pairs of comfortable shoes: one regular pair, and a casual pair of sneakers for walking and something dressy. We can\'t emphasize enough the importance of having comfortable, well-broken in shoes! You\'ll be doing a lot of "strip crawling" shopping and walking through those giant hotels. In Las Vegas, you’ll walk quite a bit. Women frequently think they need more than two-three pairs of shoes and might bring a extra\'s depending how long your staying and what your doing. Flip Flops are also recommended for the pool. </p>\n      <p>Day Clothes: sun dresses, shorts, T-shirts and tank tops are a must for daytime wear. And bring a hat or cap with a wide brim to shade the searing sun. Wear sneakers during the day is your best bet. </p>\n      <p>It is always a good idea to pack a sweater or light jacket even though it is warm (or hot) outside. It can get cool after dark and the air conditioning inside some casinos can be chilly. (The temperature difference between outside and inside a casino can be 30 degrees ...and 70 degrees can feel like 50.) </p>\n      <img class="img" src="'+o()(r)+"\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>Most hotels have swimming pools, so don’t forget to bring bathing suits and cover-ups especially during the heat of the summer.  Most pools are heated and open year round so don't be afraid to checkout the hot tub in November.  </p>\n      <p>Sunglasses are a must when traveling to Vegas. So are bringing plenty of sunscreen and Chapstick. It is recommended to wear at least a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more. </p>\n      <p>You might need such personal items as a blow dryer, travel iron (check to see if your hotel supplies them) or hair rollers. Fragile articles are accepted as checked baggage only at the customer's own risk. The better hotels supply lotions, shampoos and irons/ironing boards.  </p>\n      <p>Purchase travel size cosmetics and health/beauty aids to save space. Put cosmetics, shoe polish, nail enamel, perfume, sunscreen and anything else that might spill, spurt, break, ooze and stain your clothing into re-sealable plastic bags, a leak-proof cosmetic bag or unbreakable containers. You’ll need deodorant, toothbrushes, tooth paste, a nail clipper and (men) shaving stuff. (There is a Walgreen's across from the Park MGM hotel on the South Strip if you forget something.) </p>\n      <p>Don’t forget aspirin, Ibuprofen, Extra strength Tylenol (or some other pain killer), adhesive bandages (band-aids for bistered feet), lotion/facial mosisturizer for the dry weather ...maybe even a small first aid kit. If you get air sick easily, or on your first flight, take some sort of motion sickness drug such as Dramamine before you fly. This is a readily-obtained over-the-counter at a drug store. (Nothing will relieve motion sickness once it has started.) </p>\n      <p>If you are traveling from overseas, you will need USA plug converter so you can charge your phone charger/camera battery charger. (An AC plug converter is needed by European/Asian travelers so they can use their electronic devices.) </p>\n      <p>Packing an extra roomy, expandable travel bag is a good idea to put your souvenirs and purchases in. A couple of large plastic bags are useful for wet or dirty clothing. </p>\n      <p>A \"money belt\" - the kind that has a small purse built into a belt - is a very handy thing in Las Vegas. It allows you to easily and safely access your funds while you are walking around. </p>\n      <p>Never leave your luggage unattended. If you must leave the area where you have placed it, even for a moment, take your luggage with you. Never allow anyone that you do not know to “watch” your luggage for you and do not carry anything for someone that you do not know or watch a bag for someone that you do not know. </p>\n      <p>Keep in mind that most airlines limit carry-on bag dimensions to 9x14x22 inches (45 linear inches.) It must be able to fit in the aircraft overhead rack or under your seat. You are allowed one carry-on and a laptop computer or brief case is considered carry-on. You also carry one personal item such as a backpack, purse or camera. (It is confusing why a brief case is considered \"carry-on\" while a hand bag or purse is not! But that's the rules.)</p>\n      <p>You should always carry important travel documents (plane tickets, hotel paperwork and such) and valuable items in your carry-on luggage. It doesn’t hurt to have photocopies in your checked luggage in case the originals get lost. </p>\n      <p>Be certain to carry a government issued ID (with a photo) such as a driver’s license ...a passport and birth certificate if coming from a foreign country. You will need to show it several times during your stay. </p>\n      <p>Bring an ATM card for emergency withdrawals, a major credit card (VISA, Discover, American Express or MasterCard), and a couple of hundred in cash ...more if you plan on gambling a bit. </p>\n      <p>You’ll need a camera, or course, and plenty of film. Do not put film in your checked bag as it will get damaged when X-rayed by machines that scan checked baggage. (The scanner at the gates is less powerful and won't hurt film.) You might also take extra camera batteries. Be aware that everything is more expensive if you have to buy it in Las Vegas. </p>\n      <p>If you take medication, put it in your carry on bag so you will have it in case your checked luggage gets lost. (Not likely, but it does happen.) You might even pack a single change of clothes if you have room. Bring a pen and small notepad. </p>\n      <p>Be sure to place your name, address and itinerary on (and in) all of your bags so the airlines can find you if it gets lost. Carry a list of phone numbers important to you. Tipping is a way of life in Vegas. Carry a supply of $1 bills for tips; you will need them on your trip from the airport to the hotel.) </p>\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"third-container\">\n      <h4>Gambling at the Airport</h4>\n      <p>As soon as you exit the plane in Vegas you will hear and see the sweet sounds of slot machines. But don't be fooled, the odds on these machines are some of the worst anywhere. With a captive audience they don't need to offer better payouts... and they don't. Have some self control and pass on sliding that $20 into the machines there. Wait till your at your hotel and throw $20 into a machine at the video poker bar. Enjoy some free drinks and unwind from your traveling. Plus you might just hit a Royal Flush </p>\n      <h4>Pro Tip: COMFORTABLE SHOES ARE A MUST IN LAS VEGAS!  </h4>\n      <p> With so much to see and do in such a short time, Las Vegas will put your feet to work! On average the regular person walks 10-12 miles a day in Vegas. Having your most comfortable sneakers or shoes is a must. Save the heels for the wild nights. Bring a few Band-Aids just in case of a blister or two.  </p>\n      <h4>Vegas Nights </h4>\n      <p>Another thing people forget about Vegas, is that the town completely transforms at night and so should your attire. Upscale clothing is required at many of the nicer restaurants in town. Many even require jackets for men so check with the restaurant before making reservations. Business casual clothing is acceptable for shows. Jeans are frowned upon when it comes to performances. Casinos themselves just have shirt and shoes requirements. Its Vegas so look your best and bring the sexy! </p>\n      <h4>Night Club Dress Codes  </h4>\n      <p>Men will want to dress to impress when it comes to Vegas nightclubs. Clothing on men is often looked over carefully before entrance is allowed into some of the hottest clubs. Men shouldn’t wear jeans, hats, T-shirts, sneakers, or any kind of athletic wear. Women can sometimes wear jeans, but it is better to wear dress pants, a skirt, or a dress. Women will also not be allowed in wearing sneakers or flip flops. Dress shoes are required for everyone. Women shouldn’t wear t-shirts either. A good rule of thumb when dressing for a night on the town is to dress to impress. If the bouncers at the door don’t like what you are wearing they will not let you in. </p>\n      <h4>Taking the Bus to Las Vegas  </h4>\n      <p>The third most popular way to get to Vegas is by bus. From within 500 miles this can be an affordable option. Typically its approx. $50 each way via bus but you don't have to drive. Always compare with the cost of flying to make sure the value is there. This option takes much longer then flying but can sometimes be very cost effective. Use the time to master your favorite casino game, catch up on your e-mail and gets lots of sleep before the Vegas party starts!  </p>\n      <h4> Get excited for Vegas! </h4>\n      <p>  For some fun and excitement before the trip checkout Chevy Chase in Vegas Vacation. (1997)                        In the fourth outing for the vacation franchise, the Griswolds have to survive Vegas fever when they go to Las Vegas for a fun family vacation. Tip: Don't learn any of Clarks gambling techniques. </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</template>\n";a.default=s},"components/topDeals/topDeals.html":function(e,a,t){t.r(a);var n=t(4385),o=t.n(n),i=new URL(t(9716),t.b),r=new URL(t(2401),t.b),s=new URL(t(346),t.b),l=new URL(t(9547),t.b),h=new URL(t(620),t.b),d=new URL(t(4929),t.b),p=new URL(t(4288),t.b),u=new URL(t(8148),t.b),c=new URL(t(2386),t.b),m=new URL(t(9627),t.b),g=new URL(t(4167),t.b),f=new URL(t(4679),t.b),y=new URL(t(4455),t.b),b='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+o()(i)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class="single-wide">\n    <h2 class="shimmer">At Vegas Deal Finder we\'re always on the lookout for the latest & greatest deals in Vegas  </h2>\n    <p>Welcome!

But that\'s actually the worst option for transportation value. For only $2 you can ride the WAX bus (depending on your departure point – more on this further down). As per the shuttles, which are frequent and operate through the night, they still provide a great & affordable option if you traveled solo or with just one other person; if I travel in group of 4 or 5 people a large Uber may be a cheaper  and quicker option.  Besides the WAX bus, for one or two people the shuttle provides an affordable alternative to the ever-increasing taxi fares (with ever-increasing starting fixed rate, which is simply a rip-off – and of course the expectation of a large tip, not sure why to this date, unlike pretty much any other cab service in the rest of the world). These shuttles will take you to any main resort, even off the Strip, and they are very important for those not wanting to be ripped off by taxis the second they arrive in Las Vegas. Don\'t ride in taxis ever when in Vegas.  </p>\n      <h4>Driving To Vegas  </h4>\n      <img src="'+o()(l)+"\" class=\"img\">\n      <p>Considering a weekend getaway to Vegas? After a rough week, there's nothing like packing your bags, channeling your inner Elvis or showgirl, and heading to Sin City for glitz and good times! According to statistics compiled annually by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, approximately 26 percent of tourists who come to Las Vegas are from Southern California. If you're considering making the drive, here are a few things you should know. </p>\n      <p><b>Map your route </b>out in advance. Depending on what part of the country you're from, you're likely to be driving between 100-500 miles. Beyond that it makes more sense to Fly. Be aware that it's not a particularly scenic drive. from most directions you'll be llooking out at the open desert almost the entire way. </p>\n      <p><b>Traffic </b>Typically the average daily auto traffic into Vegas can usually be less in the evenings. Pertaining to weekend trips, most visitors tend to leave between Friday morning and very late Friday night, and then everyone heads back to between noon and 8 p.m. on Sunday.  If you can take Thursday or Monday off and travel then, you're guaranteed to encounter a lot less traffic. (Note: If you're coming to Vegas on a holiday weekend, be prepared for the longest road trip of your life. It's not uncommon for the drive to Vegas to take much longer both there and back.   </p>\n      <p><b>Gas and food stops </b>Know your mileage and try not to let the gas level fall below one-quarter of a tank. This may seem trivial, but there are a couple of sections of road coming in from all directions without gas stations for quite some time. Mark out your stops in advance based on larger cities and better places to stop. </p>\n      <p><b>Don't speed </b>Although the I-15 can be long, flat and tedious (especially the stretch through the Mojave Desert), fight your need for speed. The California Highway Patrol and Nevada Highway Patrol are always ready to hand out tickets for speeding. Expect to see strict enforcement of the speed limit there most of the way. </p>\n      <p><b>Water </b>Nevada is a desert so staying hydrated is a must. Summer temperatures in Las Vegas sometimes reach higher than 115 degrees. With that in mind, carry lots of water -- for you and your passengers as well as for your radiator in case of overheating. A gallon per person and an extra gallon for the car is a good rule of thumb. </p>\n      <p><b>Traveling with children</b>If you're looking to avoid traffic and drive in peace, consider making your journey at night. When kids have nodded off, you'll be able to log some serious miles without bathroom and snack stops or the whiny “When will we get there?” question. If you travel by day, a portable DVD player will be a godsend. It's also a good idea to plan some “I spy” spotter games and storytelling. </p>\n      <p><b>Ways to pass the time </b>There's nothing better to get you in the Sin City mood than a collection of Vegas-themed songs for the road.   Also, be sure to bring information about Las Vegas with you. You can start to make plans. If you have great phone or wireless service, you can even make room reservations, view show tickets, get VIP nighclub passes, book sightseeing tours and find wonderful last-minute deals at here at VDF. </p>\n      <p><b>Service your car </b>Due for an oil change? Need coolant added? Tires low on air pressure? As the cliché goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Or, to put it more clearly, get your vehicle checked out and thoroughly serviced before you drive to Las Vegas. You should bring basic repair essentials with you to handle a flat tire. Jumper cables, a flashlight and warning devices (like flares or reflective gear) are also recommended. </p>\n      <p>With all of these things in mind, have a safe trip and don't forget to have fun. After all, you are heading to Vegas on vacation! </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"second-container\">\n      <h2>Transportation Deals </h2>\n      <p>Getting around in Las Vegas can be accomplished with relative ease once you know which method of transport is best suited to you. Below are the multitude of transportation options available and our best picks for saving money. Once you arrive in Vegas you will first need to get outside to find transportation options to your hotel. Our #1 pick is always is riding the WAX bus. For only $2 (you can buy tickets at locations in the airport or have exact change and pay on the bus). The WAX bus stop at Terminal 1 is located on Level Zero. From baggage claim, take the elevator or escalator down one level. Exit the terminal building and proceed across the pedestrian crosswalk. Veer right to the covered RTC bus stop.   </p>\n      <h4>Airport Shuttle </h4>\n      <p>Several shuttle companies operate from McCarren International Airport to the Las Vegas strip, downtown Las Vegas, Boulder Highway and the outlying hotels. Travel arrangements can be made outside of the baggage claim area for one-way or round trip transport. Round trip fares are slightly less than double the one-way fare. Approximate round trip fares per person are as follows: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Strip hotels--$8.00 </li>\n        <li>Downtown hotels--$10.00</li>\n        <li>Off strip hotels--$13.50</li>\n        <li>Reservations are recommended for timely return to airport</li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Limousine Service </h4>\n      <p>Prices for limousine service in Las Vegas range between $35/hr for a basic limo up to $80/hr for a super-stretch limo. There is nothing like walking out of a limo and going inside a top casino in Vegas. However with the rise of Internet gambling some people prefer to play in the famous live dealer online casinos while enjoying their spa vacation in a Vegas hotel. Limousines also offer shuttle service between McCarren Airport and Strip hotels from about $4.00 per person and downtown hotels from about $5.00 per person, be aware that for this price it is more likely that you will be placed in a shuttle bus or van operated by the limo company.\n      Prices for limousine service in Las Vegas range between $35/hr for a basic limo up to $80/hr for a super-stretch limo. Limousines also offer shuttle service between McCarren Airport and Strip hotels from about $4.00 per person and downtown hotels from about $5.00 per person, be aware that for this price it is more likely that you will be placed in a shuttle bus or van operated by the limo company.</p>\n      <p>A fairly new option exist to pre-arrange for a limo to pick you up and/or drop you off at McCarren Airport, or anywhere else you may require a limo to take you (especially helpful if you are getting married in Las Vegas or attending a wedding during your stay). There is no cost or obligation on your part if you submit your information to have several companies bid on providing you with limo service. </p>\n      <p>If you are coming to Vegas with a large group to attend a corporate event or your best friend's bachelor / bachelorette party you will need a large vehicle to accommodate high number of passenger. VegasVIPLimo.com features super stretch SUV limousine up to 45 people from Hummer H2 to party bus </p>\n      <h4>Taxi Services </h4>\n      <p>Taxi fare in Las Vegas is governed by the Nevada Taxicab Authority and as such all fares between 16 companies operating in the Las Vegas valley will be the same. Once you enter a taxi the meter will start at $3.20. If the taximeter senses that the taxicab is moving less than 8-12 MPH, (as is the case when stuck in traffic) the taximeter will assess a charge of $.25 (twenty-five cents) every 41 seconds which equals $22/hour. While travelling at speeds above 8-12 MPH the rate is $2.00 per mile which is broken down into 1/8th of mile segments of $0.25 each. There is also an additional $1.20 fee for all trips that begin at McCarran Airport, this will result in trips to your hotel from the airport costing more than your return trip to the airport. Once the taximeter senses that the taxicab is moving at a speed greater than 8-12 MPH the fare calculates on the actual distance travelled. To recap: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>First 1/8th of a mile = $3.20 </li>\n        <li>Each additional mile = $0.25 </li>\n        <li>Waiting time = $22.00 per hour </li>\n        <li>McCarran Airport pickup fee = $1.20 </li>\n        <li>From McCarren Airport the approximate fares are as follows:  </li>\n        <ul>\n          <li>South Strip (Luxor, Mandalay, Tropicana)--$9.50-$12.00 </li>\n          <li>Center Strip (Caesars, Mirage, Harrah's)--$12.00-$15.00 </li>\n          <li>Sahara/Stratosphere--$13.00-$17.00 </li>\n          <li>Downtown Area--$17.00-$21.00 </li>\n          <li>*Note-The above rates are per car load (up to 5 passengers) not per person. Drivers are not allowed to alter from the most direct route without prior approval from the passengers. </li>\n        </ul>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Car Rentals</h4>\n      <p>Cab fares add up quickly, buses are slow and the strip is long if you are walking a lot and planning day trips away from the city then a rental car is recommended.Having a car also gets you access to several other casinos off strip where the gambling is great and there are killer coupons for food and gambling. The major car rental companies have booths at McCarren Airport but we suggest that you book your car before you leave home. Doing some reasearch can really save you some money on your rental. Having a car at your disposal will give you more time to enjoy your Las Vegas vacation without transportation worries but beware, many casinos now charge for parking. </p>\n      <h4>City Buses </h4>\n      <p>The citizens area transit or CAT is the Las Vegas public transit system. The 2 routes that most Las Vegas visitors will be concerned with are the #301 and #302 which both run the Strip from the south to Fremont street. The 301 stops at every stop along the strip while the 302 is the express bus and stops at fewer locations. Fare to use the CAT bus sytem is $2.00 with exact fare required, drivers will not make change for you.  </p>\n      <h4>Trolleys </h4>\n      <p>The trolley bus travels from The Stratosphere to the South Strip area, it does not travel to Fremont Street. Trolley bus fare is $1.50 exact fare only with hours of operation between 9:30am to 2:00am on a 20 minute schedule. The trolley bus does serve the purpose of transport and is generally less crowded than the CAT buses but be forewarned, has uncomfortable wooden seats (nostalgic I suppose) and stops at every major hotel along the strip making transport slower. </p>\n      <h4>Las Vegas Monorail </h4>\n      <p>The Las Vegas monorail runs from the MGM Grand Hotel to Sahara Ave. The Las Vegas Monorail operates 7 days a week from 7:00am to 2:am Monday - Thursday and until 3:00am Friday - Sunday, Each car on the Monorail holds 72 riders seated and 152 riders standing with the approx. time to ride from one end of the 4 mile long Las Vegas strip is being 14 to 16 minutes, depending on the speed of boarding and unloading passengers. </p>\n      <p>The monorail tickets can be purchased at vending machines located inside each station and at station hotel properties and online. Monorail ticket prices are as follows: Normal Fare Rates: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>1 ride pass $5.00 </li>\n        <li>2 ride pass $9 </li>\n        <li>10 ride pass $35 </li>\n        <li>1 Day pass $8 (Summer Special) </li>\n        <li>3 Day pass $40 </li>\n        <li>Children 5 and under FREE </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>For the current status of the monorail or to purchase advices tickets please visit the\n        <a href=\"http://lvmonorail.com/\" class=\"normalLink\">Las Vegas monorail website</a>\n      </p>\n      <p>1 ride pass is good for 1 entry to monorail system </p>\n      <p>10 ride pass good for 10 entrances, any station(s). This pass is valid for 1 year from first use. </p>\n      <p>1 day pass offers unlimited entrances, any station(s) is valid for 24 hour period from first use. </p>\n      <p>3 day pass offers unlimited entrances, any station(s) is valid for 72 hour period from first use. Stations located along the monorail system are: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>MGM Grand station </li>\n        <li>Bally's - Paris station </li>\n        <li>Flamingo - Caesars Palace station </li>\n        <li>Harrah's - Imperial Palace station </li>\n        <li>Las Vegas Convention Center station </li>\n        <li>Las Vegas Hilton station </li>\n        <li>Sahara station </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>Free Shuttles </h4>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Barbary Coast, Gold Coast, Orleans shuttle - Shuttle bus runs every 20-25 minutes to each of the above mentioned casinos between 9:30a.m. and Midnight. Catch the Barbary shuttle at the side entrance on Flamingo Road. Use the Barbary Coast to the Gold Coast shuttle and you can walk to the Rio which is located beside the Gold Coast.</li>\n        <li>Harrah's to The Rio - Shuttles run on an approximate 30 minute schedule to each property between the hours of 10 a.m and 1a.m. Loading at the Rio is at the side entrance, loading at Harrah's is at the entrance at rear of casino next to the check-in counter.</li>\n        <li>Sam's Town shuttle - Shuttles run from Sam's Town on the Boulder Highway to several Las Vegas locations every 45 to 60 minutes between the hours of 8 a.m and 11:30 p.m. depending on which route you are using. Shuttle run from Sam's Town to the following properties, Stardust, Fremont, California, Bourbon Street, San Remo and Harrah's. Although the Sam's Town web site says that a room key may be required we have never heard of anyone being asked to show a key.</li>\n        <li>Hard Rock shuttle - The Hard Rock shuttle picks up passengers about once per hour between 10 a.m. and 7p.m. Shuttle stops at the Forum Shops at 10 past the hour, Fashion show Mall at 15 minutes past the hour and the Stardust at 20 minutes past the hour.

The same tram on the return (northbound) trip from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur provides a stop at the Luxor for those wishing to visit there.</li>\n      </ol>\n      <h4>Walking and Your Safety </h4>\n      <p>The Las Vegas Strip is over 4 miles long from one end to the other, walking the strip will take considerable time. If you decide to try walking here are a few tips: </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>At night stay on the Strip and do not walk alone if you can avoid it. Las Vegas is, generally speaking, a safe city but like any other is not excluded from crime. </li>\n        <li>Wear comfortable, good fitting shoes.  </li>\n        <li>Summer months are very hot, during daytime walks take bottled water with you and stop often at the casinos to get a fresh bottle. </li>\n        <li>Obey walk signals at traffic lights, many tourists are hit by cars every week driven by other tourists that are looking at the sights. </li>\n        <li>When walking on the Las Vegas Strip you will be handed pamplets and magazines with pictures or ads for sex that may be objectionable to you. Do not hold out your hand to take them, the people that are giving them away will not bother or harass you in any way if you ignore them. </li>\n      </ol>\n      <h4>PRO TIP:  </h4>\n      <p>Track you daily steps with your phone to see just how much you walked each day! Its not uncommon to log well over 20,000 steps in a day. Our personnel record is 28,500 Steps. Who needs the gym when your knocking out mile after to mile with just your own two feet!  </p>\n\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"third-container\">\n      <img src=\"https://vegasdealfinder.com/resources/Pictures/Lyft-vs-Uber-4.png\" class=\"img\">\n      <h4>Use Lyft and Uber from the Airport </h4>\n      <p>Lyft and Uber are the fastest way to get to your hotel while saving money compared to a taxi.  VDF recommends always using ride sharing in Vegas instead of a Taxi.  Ride sharing is generally very convenient and always more affordable. </p>\n      <p>Terminal 1Uber/Lyft Pickup:    After baggage claim, take the elevator near door #2 up to the second level. You will then need to cross the pedestrian bridge to Terminal 1 parking garage. Pickup is there.  </p>\n      <p>Ride Share Pick up from Terminal 3</p>\n      <p>The Ride Share pick up is located on the Valet level of the Terminal 3 parking garage </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>From Baggage Claim, take the elevator near door #52, #54 or #56 up to level 1. </li>\n        <li>Cross the pedestrian bridge on level 1 to the Terminal 3 Parking Garage. </li>\n      </ol>\n      <h4>Walking the Strip </h4>\n      <p>If your feeling crazy and want to try walking the length of the strip be prepared. although it never appears to be that far away, Vegas casinos are huge and the walk is always longer then it looks. Its approx. 4.2 miles from one end of the strip to the other. Going into and exploring individual casinos can add many more miles to your walking tour. </p>\n      <h4>Find the Shortest Route </h4>\n      <p>In Las Vegas just finding your way out of the Hotel or Casino can be a task. Walk out the wrong end of the casino and you could be adding 1/2 mile to your walk. Its always best to either know exactly where to go or simply ask a hotel employee for the best way to get to wherever you're going. Yes guys.... that means you too!!  </p>\n      <h4>Proper footwear </h4>\n      <p>If your planning on logging a lot of your travel while in Vegas via walking then make sure you bring your most comfortable shoes. We recommend sneakers those long days on your feet but comfy and classier dress shoes can also do the trick. Having proper footwear can make all the difference in your trip. One huge blister on your foot and you will never forget again.  </p>\n      <h4>Parking Parking FREE PARKING</h4>\n      <p>Did you know: Some Strip resorts now charge for parking. Aria, New York-New York, Vdara, MGM Grand and others now charge visitors for self- and valet parking. </p>\n      <p><b>But you can still find free parking along the Strip, if you know where to go. </b></p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Circus-Circus - Self-parking is free, but valet is not. Expect to pay $10 for up to four hours, and $15 for four to 24 hours.</li>\n        <li>The Cosmopolitan - Self and valet parking are free, but only until May 16. After that, you get one free hour of self-parking and will pay $7 for up to four hours and $10 for four to 24 hours. And yes, that applies to hotel guests too. </li>\n        <li>SLS - All parking is free here. Plus, the hotel is the northernmost stop for the Las Vegas Monorail if you want to use public transit. </li>\n        <li>Stratosphere - The Stratosphere Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. This iconic spot offers free self- and valet parking. </li>\n        <li>Treasure Island - Not only does this independently owned hotel-casino not charge guests, but it intends to begin advertising as a fee-free parking destination on the Strip.</li>\n        <li>Trump International Hotel - Only valet parking is offered, but it’s complimentary.</li>\n        <li>The Venetian and the Palazzo - The Palazzo and the Venetian, right, offer complimentary self- and valet parking. These sister properties are the only remaining mega-resorts that don’t charge for parking. Hotel officials say they have no plans to start charging either. </li>\n        <li>Wynn Las Vegas - Self-parking is free, but Wynn and Encore charge for valet services. </li>\n        <li>Shopping centers - Parking is free at several shopping centers along the Strip, including The Shops at Mandalay Bay (between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor), the Shops at Crystals (in front of Aria and Vdara) and Fashion Show Mall (across the street from Wynn-Encore).</li>\n      </ol>\n      <h4>Who Charges to Park? </h4>\n      <p>The MGM Grand is one of the casino properties in Las Vegas that charges customers for parking. </p>\n      <p>Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts have implemented fees for self-parking and valet at a broad swath of their properties along Las Vegas Boulevard.   </p>\n      <p>Want to pop into Bellagio or Aria for a meal or a show? They chrage $20 for up to four hours in valet parking. </p>\n      <p>If you’re staying overnight, paying $25 for parking probably makes sense. Even with the increases, it’s still cheaper to valet park in Vegas than in other big cities, such as New York and San Francisco.. but its still sucks. </p>\n      <h4>Need a Wheelchair or Mobility Scooter while in Vegas?</h4>\n      <p>With so much walking and so much to see some people may want to consider renting a portable scooter to get them around with less toll on their bodies.
