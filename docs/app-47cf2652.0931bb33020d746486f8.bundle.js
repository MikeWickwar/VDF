Park MGM pool oasis has three pools, a heated hot tub, two bars and plenty of comfy spots for lounging. Palms sway overhead and striped mint umbrellas bring the shade. Poolside service will have a Frosé or Park Punch in your hand in no time. Nosh on a Tuna Poke Bowl or Watermelon & Arugula Salad or go all in on the Fajita Chicken Nachos and a bucket of craft beer. Reserved seating is available, with extra perks, and when you\'re looking for a little more room and shade for two (or even three), they have daybeds in prime positions by the pool. Baja Ledge Chairs let you lie back and enjoy both the water and the sun, and booking one of our 12 cabanas is like holding court in your very own VIP clubhouse. Rolling deep?
