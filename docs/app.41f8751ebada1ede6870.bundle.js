Rather than wasting energy on empty space by cooling from the ceiling, slot machine bases serve as floor air-handling units that efficiently cool players from the ground up. This, in turn, pushes air contaminants up and away from guests. Various table games also contain an air-curtain that shoots directly up from the table, which rids the air of smoke. ARIA Casino is the first casino on The Strip to use this technology and has received LEED Certification for its efforts.","slotImg":"https://flightcentre-us.leonardocontentcloud.com/imageRepo/7/0/105/353/774/ARIA_-_Casino_Slots_P.jpg","pokerBlurb":"How\'s your Poker Face? - Poker, in its many different forms, is one of the premier gambling games in the world.

One of the most important moves when coming to Vegas and looking to start creating your own deals is to get a players card and use it where & when you play.  Most casinos offers some type of Free give away just for signing up. This could be free play, match plays, free food, or other trinkets.  Getting a players card allows the casino to track your gambling which can in turn generate comps (free complimentary things, like food, shows, rooms and more).  You might also start to receive additional offers from the casino for rooms, food and more via the mail and e-mail.  This is the easiest way to take advantage of all of the casinos promotional offers like coupons and giveaways. You can sign up at the casinos players club, make it the first stop at every casino.  For a list of Casinos with great sign up promotions,  Join VDF today and start mapping out your assault on Vegas !\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <h4>#2 - Use Coupons:</h4>  At VDF we recommend utiziling every possible coupon offer available to you as a consumer.  Yes coupons in Vegas!! Buy one Get one free's, Casino Matchplay's, 1/2 Off Deals, Freebies and more. Many coupons are available from local guide books and directly from the casinos at check in.

Casinos offer free drinks to customers who are gambling... or look like their gambling.  Simply put your players card and some money in a machine and order your cocktail.  We suggest playing near the cocktail station for quicker service and remember to always tip a minimum of one dollar per drink.  At VDF we recommend you not purchasing any drinks from the casino bars unless they are running a special, happy hour or just serve cheap drinks.
