They also feature exclusive products and launches and have a text rewards program,  and special overnight deals available midnight-8am. </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://reefdispensaries.com/locations/las-vegas/">REEF DISPENSARIES</a></h4>\n      <p>Off the StripReef Dispensaries has several locations throughout Nevada, but their flagship store is the one near the Strip (and next to Planet 13, as luck has it), which kind of looks like an ultralounge-meets-Apple store (actually, most dispensaries look like this).  </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://thesourcenv.com/">THE+SOURCE </a></h4>\n      <p>Henderson and Westside are the two locations in the Las Vegas Valley, The+Source offers more than 30 different strains of cannabis and a variety of concentrates, edibles, and more. They\'re also known for their top-notch customer service, "higher education" informative seminars, and great customer rewards program.  </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://essencevegas.com/">ESSENCE CANNABIS DISPENSARIES </a></h4>\n      <p>Near Sahara, Henderson, Tropicana WestEssence has three locations around Las Vegas, and is the only dispensary to have a location that\'s actually on the Strip. Do keep in mind, though, it\'s waaaaay North Strip across from the Strat. Inside, the multiple-award-winning stores are super-sleek, and they offer a wide selection of products including over 50 strains of flower and pre-rolls, edibles (cookies, chocolates, gummies, infused-drinks), vape pens, concentrates, and topicals. Check out their daily deals and discounts calendar and sign up for text alerts to save some green.  </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://www.lasvegasreleaf.com/">LAS VEGAS RELEAF DISPENSARY </a></h4>\n      <p>Near Sahara casino Las VegasClose to the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center, ReLeaf shirks the stylish tech showroom look popular with most dispensaries for more of a trendy lounge/bar feel, and they proudly proclaim to have the world\'s first and only "tasting bar" inside a dispensary.  ReLeaf has some of the best prices and deals you\'re going to find in Vegas, especiallythis close to the Strip.   </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://medmen.com/">MEDMEN</a></h4>\n      <p>Off the Strip, Arts DistrictMedMen has two locations in Las Vegas, one near the Strip and the other in the Downtown Las Vegas Arts District. The location on Harmon (across from the soon-to-be Virgin Hotels Las Vegas) is open 24 hours, while the Arts District location is one of the only dispensaries downtown.  If you\'re looking to get into some downtown shenanigans (and you really should be), this is your best bet.  </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://www.theapothecaryshoppe.com/">THE APOTHECARY SHOPPE </a></h4>\n      <p>Across from the Palms Casino, this olde world-y upscale dispensary -- you can tell it\'s olde world-y and upscale because of the extra "pe" at the end of "Shop," and also because it looks like the retail side of a fancy cigar lounge -- is especially known for its gourmet edible confections made by an executive pastry chef with over a decade of experience in some of the most renowned restaurants on the Strip.  Check out their daily deals on the website. </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://apothecarium.com/las-vegas">THE APOTHECARIUM </a></h4>\n      <p>WestsideWith chandeliers hanging overhead, the Apothecarium looks more like a fancy hotel lobby than a dispensary, which is fitting since it\'s located out in the fancy western suburbs of Las Vegas. They\'ve got your flowers, topicals, concentrates, and all kinds of edible treats, and they also host a number of in-store events including visits from growers, member support groups, and educational classes.  </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://jardinlasvegas.com/">JARDIN</a></h4>\n      <p>EastsideIf Planet 13 embodies the over-the-top entertainment side of the Las Vegas dispensary, Jardin embraces the image-conscious side of Vegas. If you want the full Vegas experience of feeling like you\'re living in a music video, this is for you. If you care more about the products cultivated rather than the image cultivated, this is probably not your spot. Also note that "Jardin" is also the name of a restaurant inside the Encore, before you start lazily GPSing. </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://thegrovenv.com/">THE GROVE</a></h4>\n      <p>Near McCarran International AirportWelcome to Las Vegas! Now go get you some weed. The Grove is right by the airport, making it a convenient first stop for all you weekend warriors, plus it\'s open 24 hours daily!   </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://oasiscannabis.com/">OASIS CANNABIS </a></h4>\n      <p>Stripper Row - Oasis is your friendly neighborhood dispensary. Much like most of the other spots, they\'ve got a sleek showroom and a nice selection, they\'re located on Stripper Row, and they\'re open 24/7. But they\'ve also got a great rewards program and daily deals, better prices than most of their competitors, and excellent edibles. </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://thedispensarynv.com/">THE DISPENSARY</a></h4>\n      <p>Southwest, Henderson- The Dispensary is a locals\' joint for local joints. They’ve got some of the lowest prices with a ton of great specials on top of it. There are two locations in the Las Vegas area and while these are certainly smaller stores than some of the flashier competition, they\'re able to focus all the more on their customer service. If you care more about quality service and good prices than curb appeal, check this place out. </p>\n      <h4><a href="https://acrescannabis.com/">ACRES CANNABIS </a></h4>\n      <p>15 minute walk from Palace StationAcres Cannabis is Vegas\'s farm-to-bong cultivator and dispensary. Their cultivation operation spans over 37 acres in the Mojave Desert and produces more than 60 strains of cannabis throughout the year. With their own 2,000-square-foot "cannabis kitchen" with an open view to customers, you can actually watch them make gourmet chocolates and pastries including cookies, donuts, chocolate-covered popcorn and pretzels, brownies, and candies fresh daily, and also watch their cannabis extraction operations. And every Friday and Saturday from 11pm to 7am, Acres presents The Underground: Marijuana Farmers Market, allowing small growers and producers a space to share their creations direct with their customers. It\'s a farmer\'s market for pot.  </p>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n';a.default=i},"components/entertainment/ae/euroPools/euroPools.html":function(e,a,t){t.r(a);var n=t(14385),s=t.n(n),o=new URL(t(10832),t.b),i='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+s()(o)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n\n    <div class="single-wide">\n      <h2>European Style: Best Topless Pools in Las Vegas</h2>\n      <p>Adults-only pools have been making a splash in Las Vegas for a few years now. And just like everything Las Vegas does, the European-style sun bathing experience doesn’t just offer a bunch of topless women laying poolside. While that in itself may sound like a perfect pool experience, Las Vegas’ European pools give you so much more. From exotic nightlife atmospheres to poolside massages and blackjack tables here are the best topless pools in Las Vegas: </p>\n      <h4>Tao Beach at the <a href="#/hotels/TheVenetian">Venetian</a></h4>\n      <p>By far one of the most popular pools in Las Vegas, Tao Beach just got hotter with the addition of European-style sunbathing every Monday through Wednesday. The topless addition is on top of an already exotic and sophisticated experience where daybeds, cabanas, and a 30-foot bar are just a small part of the sin you can experience here. </p>\n      <h4>Venus at <a href="#/hotels/CaesarsPalace">Caesars Palace</a></h4>\n      <p>More than just a topless, European sunbathing experience, Venus is Las Vegas nightlife at it’s finest. The nude sunbathers are almost an after thought to the live music, modern vibe and attentive service you’ll experience at this European-style pool. And to ensure your privacy, Venus does not allow cameras, or video recorders of any kind. Venus is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>\n      <h4>Bare Pool Lounge at the <a href="#/hotels/TheMirage">Mirage</a></h4>\n      <p>The name says it all. Bare Pool at the Mirage takes topless sunbathing to a whole new level. Guests will feel more like they’re enjoying a day at the spa then laying out in the hot Las Vegas sun. Thanks to towering palm trees that seclude the pool, bottle service, day beds, cabanas, two luxury dipping pools and plenty of pampering, Bare Pool is the way European sun-bathing should be. Bare Pool is open Thursday through Monday11 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>\n      <h4>Moorea Beach Club at <a href="#/hotels/MandalayBay">Mandalay Bay  </a></h4>\n      <p>Described as a “private, sophisticated European bathing experience,” Moorea Beach Club is located off the Beach at Mandalay Bay and is surrounded by frosted panes that offer a sense of privacy from the rest of Mandalay Bay’s pool goers. Cushioned chaise lounges, poolside massage services, personal attendants, days beds and pavilions make Moorea Beach Club one of the most topnotch topless European pools in Las Vegas. Moorea goes topless Friday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>\n      <h4>European Pools at <a href="#/hotels/Wynn">Wynn</a>and <a href="#/hotels/EncoreatWynn">Encore</a></h4>\n      <p>Both Wynn and Encore offer European-style pools for their hotel guests looking to relax in the warm Las Vegas sun. Encore’s topless pool has a bar in the center of it, just in case you need a drink or two before removing your top and Wynn’s has blackjack tables if you like betting in the buff! </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n</template>\n';a.default=i},"components/entertainment/ae/legalCanna/legalCanna.html":function(e,a,t){t.r(a);var n=t(14385),s=t.n(n),o=new URL(t(10832),t.b),i=new URL(t(24602),t.b),r=new URL(t(59615),t.b),l=new URL(t(59299),t.b),h=new URL(t(77259),t.b),c='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+s()(o)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n\n    <div class="triple-wide">\n      <div class="first-container">\n        <h4>Weed Dispensary Pro Tips for Visitors </h4>\n        <img class="img" src="'+s()(i)+'" alt="">\n        <p>Many dispensaries are located on “Stripper Row,” actually an industrial road full of warehouses and the like but also full of strip clubs and, now, dispensaries. Some of the most Vegas-y dispensaries (Planet 13, Reef) are located in this area in very near proximity to some of Vegas’s best gentlemen’s clubs (The Rhino, Sapphire). Staying at Circus Circus or the Strat puts you very close to all of these things, and they’re also the best values on the Strip (and both have newly remodeled rooms!). And now your Sin City weekend is planned, you’re welcome. </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class="second-container">\n        <img class="img" src="'+s()(r)+'" alt="">\n        <p>You can buy weed in Nevada with zero hassle from the cops. The introduction of legal recreational cannabis in 2017 opened the door to quick and easy sales -- no medical marijuana card required. But there\'s still a lot of confusion about where you can actually enjoy the stuff. Despite the boom of cannabis culture and tons of dispensaries in Las Vegas, the topic remains a bit complicated. So let\'s sort it all out with your complete guide to lighting up a fat one in Sin City. </p>\n        <h4>Is marijuana legal in Nevada for everyone? </h4>\n        <p>Anyone who is 21 and over can purchase cannabis in Nevada for recreational purposes. Just bring a valid government-issued driver\'s license, ID or passport. It can\'t be expired and must be scannable to confirm it\'s the real deal. </p>\n        <h4>Do dispensaries keep a record of my personal information? </h4>\n        <p>No. It is not permitted to keep information for recreational customers.  The records are destroyed daily and are not reported to the state. Please note, your information can be used for marketing purposes if you elect to join a dispensory  loyalty program. </p>\n        <h4>Can I consume marijuana in public?  </h4>\n        <p>Legally, no, But it happens all the time on the Strip. Consumption is only legal in a private residence. There are no consumption lounges or any other public space where smoking, eating, or ingesting cannabis is allowed.  </p>\n        <h4>No big deal. I can just smoke in the privacy of my hotel room, right? </h4>\n        <p>Eh, not really. A hotel is not a private residence where you can freely smoke weed -- and neither is an apartment if the owner or landlord has rules against it. But let\'s stay focused on hotels. Most big resorts on the Strip have a casino and no one wants to risk their gaming license by mixing gambling with marijuana, which is still illegal in the eyes of the federal government. Even resorts without casinos on the Strip tend to have strong rules against smoking of any kind in their rooms these days.  But let\'s be real. If you consume cannabis in a hotel room without bothering anyone else, will you get in trouble? Probably not. Especially if you stay away from products that produce smoke. Just know the rules and consequences -- and use your best judgment  </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class="third-container">\n        <img class="img" src="'+s()(l)+'" alt="">\n        <h4>Medical vs. Recreational</h4>\n        <p>Out-of-state medical cards are accepted in Nevada, which typically means cheaper bud and faster service (just bring all your paperwork). Some places are recreational only, though, and our list highlights the best recreational picks. As with restaurant menus, online dispensary menus tend not to be up-to-date with current inventory, so if there is something very specific you want, you may want to give them a call first. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="'+s()(h)+'" alt="">\n        <h4>Ways to save </h4>\n        <p>Lots of places offer freebies and special discounts for first-timers as well as customer loyalty programs and different daily deals. If you’re new to cannabis, every dispensary is staffed with friendly budtenders to help you navigate your way to living your best high. As a general rule, the closer you are to the Strip, the more expensive the place is -- just like with everything else on or near the Strip, you are paying the Vegas tourist tax. Also be aware of additional taxes, as very few places include the 10% sales tax in their sticker price. </p>\n        <button type="button" name="button" id="dispListBtn"><a href="#/dispList">DISPENSARY LIST</a></button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n';a.default=c},"components/entertainment/coupons/coupons.html":function(e,a,t){t.r(a);var n=t(14385),s=t.n(n),o=new URL(t(21075),t.b),i=new URL(t(6446),t.b),r=new URL(t(55523),t.b),l='<template class="single-wide">\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+s()(o)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <h2>Using Coupons to see shows in Vegas </h2>\n  <p>Eating in Vegas can get expensive quickly and sometimes we like to splurge on something special.

As with Pyramid of Khafre, Luxor is guarded by a great Sphinx statue - although the Vegas version is newer, the resemblance is striking. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/xluxor-las-vegas-vs-real-pyramid-in-giza.jpg.pagespeed.ic._pYlmFcNY2.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>If you happen to be passing by Luxor hotel at night, you will notice another interesting landmark - the Sky Beam. In fact, you will notice it from anywhere in Las Vegas - it\'s the brightest light beam not just in Vegas, but in the entire world!

Screenings change every 30 minutes or so, and the Research Center attracts just a modest crowd. </p>\n        <p>When passing by MGM Grand, especially if you are with your kids, you could also drop by M&M World located nearby - it\'s a paradise for chocolate lovers, and is free to enter.  </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/xmms-world-las-vegas.jpg.pagespeed.ic.Jv3DqE0tDH.jpg" alt="">\n        <li>New York New York Hotel & Casino 3790 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>\n        <p>New York New York hotel is themed after New York City. Of course it would be impossible to recreate an entire city on such a small territory, so what they did was take the most famous NYC landmarks and throw them in together to create this masterpiece. </p>\n        <p>There is plenty of free Las Vegas to see outside. Other than the obvious Statue of Liberty and NYC skyscrapers that are approximately 1/3 size of the original, we\'d like to draw your attention to a few other landmarks featured at New York New York Hotel Las Vegas. </p>\n        <p>Grand Central Terminal </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/newyork-hotel-las-vegas-vs-new-york-city-grand-central-terminal.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>Brooklyn Bridge </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/newyork-hotel-las-vegas-vs-new-york-city-brooklyn-bridge.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>Soldiers And Sailors Monument </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/newyork-hotel-las-vegas-vs-new-york-city-soldiers-and-sailors-monument.jpg" alt="">\n        <li>CityCenter Waldorf Astoria Hotel, 3730 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>\n        <p>CityCenter is an urban complex that consists of several beautiful, modern hotels that have one thing in common - a water and crystal theme.  </p>\n        <p>We will briefly look at the hotels located inside CityCenter to notice the beautiful design. We\'d like to draw your attention to many water features located outside of Aria Hotel. If you have the time, walk inside Aria, too - they have plenty of free artwork displayed everywhere. If art is your thing, you won\'t find any better free to see Las Vegas. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aria-fountains-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>As they say at Aria themselves, always look up - you might find something interesting there - for example, a silver replica of Colorado River installed in the lobby. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aria-lobby-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/art-gallery-dale-chihuly-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <li>Bellagio 3600 S.

The Fountains run on schedule, from every 15 minutes to every 30 minutes during operating hours. Current hours is Monday - Friday from 3:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m, Saturdays and Sundays - from 12:00 p.m to 12:00 am.

Las Vegas Blvd. </li>\n        <p>Paris Hotel, there is no need to go inside as they don\'t run any actual free shows, but we will find plenty of free Las Vegas shows outside the hotel (unless you want to take a close look at the replica of Le Pont Alexandre III from Paris located inside the hotel.</p>\n        <p>The hotel\'s main attraction - Eiffel Tower - is hard to miss. It\'s free to explore it from the outside, however, if you want to ride the elevator and check out the Strip from top of the Tower - it will cost you $7.50 to $22.00 or, will be free with Power Pass that grants access to multiple attractions and plenty of free Las Vegas shows and things to do. Eiffel Tower is almost exact replica of the real thing, except twice as small. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/paris-hotel-eifel-tower-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <li>Flamingo  3555 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>\n        <p>Flamingo Hotel - home to Flamingo Wildlife Habitat. Here are 3 reasons why. 1. You love flamingos, 2. You\'ve never seen them, and 3. You have kids. Otherwise, you can do without it. </p>\n        <p>In the habitat, flamingos simply walk around among hotel guests. Don\'t get us wrong, they are quite pretty, but if we are looking for free Las Vegas shows, we want more than just walking birds! </p>\n        <li>Caesars Palace 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>\n        <p>Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino - the one you saw in the hit comedy "Hangover"! And if you are still wondering - no, Caesar never lived here. Although if he lived in the 21st century and wanted to have a palace, he would probably choose this place. There are plenty of free Las Vegas shows at Caesars Palace. </p>\n        <p>The first thing you notice is Roman statues, including a reproduction of David by Michelangelo. Take your time and have a look around, if you like statues. But now you probably heard about moving statues at Caesars Palace which is among the most famous free Las Vegas shows. </p>\n        <p>However, not all the statues here can move. To watch the show, you need to go to Forum Shops - a shopping center located inside Caesars Palace. The Fall of Atlantis show, using animatronic statues, runs every hour starting at 11:00 a.m. and until 11 p.m or 12 p.m. </p>\n        <p>The show tells the story of a feud between a brother and a sister, who can\'t decide who will rule Atlantis. They fight using water and fire, gods interfere, and Atlantis falls...to rise again the next hour. I can\'t think of another city that falls and rises that often </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/fall-of-atlantis-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>As you are exploring the Forum Shops, notice the aquarium, located near the Fall Of Atlantis show. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aquarium-forum-shops-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>The Colosseum - It looks pretty much like the real Colosseum in Rome. This is the venue where sing Celine Dion, Rod Stewart and Elton John. </p>\n        <li>The Mirage Hotel 3400 S. Las Vegas Blvd.  </li>\n        <p>Mirage is known for the most "explosive" shows performed by a an artificial erupting Volcano installed in front of the hotel. The show runs every hour from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. nightly. </p>\n        <p>The show is accompanied by music (I wish real volcanoes followed this example!). When it\'s not erupting, the Volcano turns into a peaceful waterfall. Again, a great example for all other volcanoes. As it\'s one of the most popular free Las Vegas shows, be sure to arrive in advance - it gets quite crowded her </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/mirge-volcano-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>Saw the volcano? Don\'t leave yet! Pop inside the hotel to check out the tropical rainforest (atrium) of The Mirage. It really creates illusion of a mirage in the middle of a desert - very beautiful and smells so nice. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/atrium-mirage-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>And if you have kids, or love fish (or fishing!) and the aquarium at Forums Shops wasn\'t enough, check out the Aquarium inside the lobby of the Mirage. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aquarium-mirage-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <li>The Venetian Hotel  Address: 3355 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>\n        <p>As much as we love fish and rainforests, we need to move on - we have completely different free Las Vegas shows waiting for us at The Venetian Hotel, or, in particular, at the Grand Canal Shoppes. </p>\n        <p>Here, we are going to watch a beautiful Italian themed production of Carnevale di Venezia, also known as Streetmosphere - incredibly beautiful free Las Vegas shows, where "Street" performers dressed in costumes of Italian Renaissance period, sing Italian songs and opera. </p>\n        <p>They have a complex schedule, but performances start at 12:00 p.m. and last until 6:30 p.m. You can find performers at the St. Mark\'s Square or Barney\'s New York. </p>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/streetmosphere-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>Don\'t leave yet! Did you like statues at Caesars Palace? Well here at The Venetian they have something almost just as cool (or spooky - depends on how you look at it) - the living statues. These are actually people dressed as statues that move very little. A proof that in order to work at The Venetian you either need to sing or to move to stand still for hours. </p>\n        <li>Fashion Show Mall 3200 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>\n        <p>Fashion Mall - Ready for something new? Free fashion shows!

Be sure to arrive to the Midway located inside the hotel at 11:00 a.m. - because that\'s when the fun begins. </p>\n        <p>Well let us tell you - it\'s not Cirque du Soleil, but these free Las Vegas shows are the next best thing. You will see acrobats, jugglers, clowns and pretty much everything that comes to mind when you think of a circus - except animals. </p>\n        <li>Stratosphere  2000 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>\n        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/circus-circus-shows-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">\n        <p>Stratosphere.
