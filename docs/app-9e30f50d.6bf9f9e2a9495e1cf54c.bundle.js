Find a fun prize for the winner and make the loser buy dinner... or at least the next drink. Track the wins at loss totals from each casino on the printable scorecard. and tally to see who wins the most money. Trust me, if you play just the coupons and no other bets then you will win!! For another fun play, add $5 to your totals for every free drink each person receives while playing their free play or matchplay coupons.  </p>\n      <h2>Free Drinks </h2>\n      <p>When attempting to get free drinks while using coupons can sometimes be tricky. Your only at the tables or machines for a few moments so timing is everything. Make sure you know where the cocktail waitress is before determining where your going to play your matchplay. For Freeplay coupons we always recommend you head right to the video poker bar and play your free $5-10. There you can quickly get a free drink from the bartender. Put your card in, transfer over your freeplay money to that machine and your gambling! If you don\'t rush playing through your freeplay money you might just be around long enough to get another free drink for your walk to the next casino. If you do double your money,  then you may want to cashout and record a winning amount on your scorecard and move on to the next deal....with your free drink of course. </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n';t.default=r},"Components/gambling/gamblingCouponRun/freeOnFremont/freeOnFremont.html":function(e,t,n){n.r(t);var o=n(14385),a=n.n(o),s=new URL(n(13288),n.b),i=new URL(n(24067),n.b),r='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+a()(s)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n    <div class="single-wide">\n      <h1>Free on Fremont</h1>\n      <h3>What to do and see for free while on a Fremont St. Coupon Run </h3>\n      <h4>ONE-OF-A-KIND HISTORY</h4>\n      <p>Throughout Fremont St are vintage refurbished neon signs.

Fremont not only charted important trails crisscrossing the American West, but also helped reroute the Old Spanish Trail (established 1829) from Santa Fe to Los Angles near an oasis located in today’s Downtown Las Vegas.  Fremont’s mapmaking, the booming California Gold Rush, and the snow-free Western trail through town helped Downtown Las Vegas grow.  With the railroad arriving in 1905, development along Fremont Street straight out from the train station formed Downtown Las Vegas.  The city’s oldest casino (the Golden Gate from 1906) still stands on Fremont Street, but many other things have changed.  Fremont Street became home to many other firsts in Vegas over the years including the 1st phone in 1907, the 1st paved road in 1925, later the 1st traffic light, and city’s 1st neon light at the Overland Hotel in 1928.  There was a bit of a Speakeasy era in Vegas as gambling was outlawed from 1909-1931 (drinking 1920-1933).  Pressure from The Great Depression and an influx of workers building the Hoover Dam (1931-1935, originally called Boulder Dam) forced them to open gambling back up with the first official Nevada gaming license going to Fremont Street’s Northern Club.  With gambling legal again, Fremont Street boomed through mobster influence although the casinos were mainly dingy sawdust-floored Western-themed establishments. </p>\n      <p>Finally, Downtown started classing up when the Horseshoe became the first casino to get carpeting and new hotels like Binions pushed the limits to bring in more high rollers.  Fremont Street turned into a sea of dizzying neon marquees nicknamed the Glitter Glutch by the 1940s and started adding large casino complexes by the 1950s.  As the only place in America with statewide gambling from 1931-1979, Downtown Las Vegas became a magnet for Hollywood celebrities looking to escape California.  Today the highlights of Downtown Las Vegas still center on Fremont Street with its mixture of vintage touches and modern technological features.  Visitors looking for flares of Americana and old world Vegas will love the historic neon signage, free nightly concerts, cheap drinks, loose slots, and a compact feel of Fremont Street.  Seekers of more modern flair will enjoy not only the zip line that cuts right through Downtown, but also the Fremont Street Experience which is by far Downtown’s main highlight. </p>\n      <h3>HERE ARE SOME GREAT STOPS ON FREMONT STREET </h3>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Main Street Station Casino:<p>The railroad-themed Main Station Casino and Brewery serves as a living museum of Casino antiques in the hotel lobby, main gambling flooring, and even outside.  The antiques can be seen 24 hours a day and the front desk has a really handy self-guided maps showing where each one is and explaining it.  By far the coolest artifact in the Main Station is in the men’s bathroom where the urinals are mounted to an actual section of the Berlin Wall!  The 12-foot-tall Berlin was 91 miles long and separated Communist East Berlin from West Berlin during the Cold War from 1961 through 1989.</p>\n          <p>Other antiques include red granite outdoor street lamps which were made in 1870 and sat in Brussels, Belgium until WW1.  Inside the casino, the main chandelier from the Figaro Opera House in Paris, France .and the ones in the Garden Court Buffet were made in the 1850’s for the San Francisco Opera House.  The main gambling room looks like an old Victorian-Era railway station with exceptional stained glass and brass chandeliers from the 1800s.  The carved Mahogany woodwork in on the hotel’s reception desk was originally the inside of a drugstore in Covington, Kentucky over 100 years ago.  Of the same era, the bronze doors and windows at the entrance to the Player’s Club was once the facade of the Kuwait Royal Bank in London, England.  If you search around the second floor there is a large vintage pool table which was used in the hit 1961 movie The Hustler. </p>\n          <p>The train and railway theme throughout the hotel is very predominate as you follow the walking tour and these elements are best seen in the Pullman rooms.  The Pullman family owned one of the railway car manufacturing companies in the country in the early-1900s.  The massive wooden doors from their Illinois mansion led the way to the Pullman Grille.  The grille feature a fireplace from a castle in Scotland and a complete railway car once owned by Little Women author Louisa May Alcott which you can go inside.  The Main Street Station was also once home to the private railway car used by Buffalo Bill Cody and Annie Oakley to travel the country in Buffalo Bill’s Old West Show from 1906 to 1917.  Unfortunately, the Buffalo Bill Car was removed in 2017 for the development of a neighboring tower the rest of the antiques at the casino make it worth a stop.  </p>\n       </li>\n       <li>Fremont Street Experience:\n         <p>The intersection of Fremont Street and Main Street is where Las Vegas was first founded in 1905 and is now the marks the beginning of the Fremont Street Experience.  At the foot of this crossroads is the Plaza Hotel (website), known as the poor man’s casino.  Even if you are not a penny pincher, head to the top of the domed viewing platform before entering the Experience to get a great elevated view down Fremont Street. </p>\n         <p>It was here at the Plaza Hotel (formerly Union Plaza) where the original Las Vegas train station (Salt Lake Depot) opened in 1905 to service the Clark Line (later bought by Union Pacific).  This route connected Salt Lake City to Los Angles and cut the transportation down to just one day, which was a big feat for the time.  This train traffic led to the founding of Las Vegas, the development of Fremont Street (paved in 1925), and all of the entertainment in Sin City.  While an influx of people was visiting Las Vegas during the construction of the Hoover Dam (1931-35) the ban on gambling (1909-1931) and drinking (1920-1933) were lifted which led to a business boom.  By 1940s Fremont Street was a sea of Neon Lights and Fremont became nicknamed the Glitter Gulch.  The full Fremont Street Experience is seven blocks long but you’re sure to be drawn to the 4-block-long, 90-foot-wide canopy over the street filled with 12.5 million colored LED bulbs called Viva Vision.  The entire area really comes to life on the top of every hour from 8pm to 1am when Viva Vision turns into a full-on light and video show synced to music on a concert quality sound system.  The light shows themselves are a reason to put Downtown Vegas on your to-do list, but stay a little longer and you’ll find a lot more to love. </p>\n         <p>Free Light Show: Daily 8pm-1am at the top of the hour.  Free Live Music: With 3 stages there is nightly free live music.   </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Golden Gate Casino:\n        <p>Founded in 1906, the Golden Gate is the oldest casino in Vegas and where it all got started.  As the railroad began to cut through Las Vegas from Salt Lake City to Los Angles, John F Miller started a hotel inside a canvas tent here (across from the train station) between 1903-05.  The following year Miller was done with a permanent structure known as the Hotel Nevada (later the Hotel Sal Sagev).  In 1907 the first phone in Las Vegas was installed in the busy Hotel Nevada.  Because gambling was made illegal in Nevada in 1909 along with drinking in 1920, the casino had to run underground until the bans were lifted in 1931 and 1933 respectively.  The name was changed to the Golden Gate in 1955 in honor of a group of investors from Oakland California who fronted the money for a large casino expansion in the hotel.  Today the bars are the main attraction at the Golden Gate Casino as they are where Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr drank during the Rat Pack days.  The quality of bartending is just as good today as it was then as the current staff has over 100 bartending championship trophies between them.  An insider tip is that you can get Golden Gate’s renowned, and huge, shrimp cocktails for just $3.99 if you sign up for their free Players Club Card.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>Cowboy Vic & Vegas Vickie Signs:\n        <p>Make sure to check out the huge Vegas Vic Cowboy and Vegas Vickie neon signs sitting at Fremont Street’s first covered intersection which are our favorite vintage signs.  The iconic waving Cowboy Vic was added to the Pioneer Club (1942-1995) in 1951 and his cowgirl partner Vegas Vickie was added to the Glitter Glutch Strip Club (1980-2016) when it opened in 1980.  Vickie is sometimes incorrectly called Sassy Sally after a strip club that sat next door from 1981 until 1999.  When the Freemont Experience was opened in 1995, Vic and Vickie were married in a formal ceremony covered by the local newspapers and news stations.  Vickie was removed for restoration in 2017 with plans to bring her back to Fremont Street soon.  Vegas has become known for its dizzying displays of neon lights since the first one was installed at the Oasis Café on Fremont Street in 1929.  This movement helped Downtown Las Vegas become a destination known as the Glitter Gluch and the signs have become an attraction of their own.  More vintage neon signs can be seen later on this Downtown Las Vegas walking tour at Fremont Street East as well as the popular Neon Museum. </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>Golden Nugget Casino:\n        <p> Known locally as The Nugget, the Golden Nugget offer the most unique experiences in Downtown Las Vegas. The experiences start when you check out the Hand of Faith which is the biggest gold nugget in existence at 61 pounds 11 ounces.  </p>\n        <p>About The Golden Nugget Casino:  The Nugget also has the most unique pool experience in Vegas called The Shark Tank Pool (website) where they have you swimming with the sharks.  A 30-foot-high glass slide forms a long tunnel taking your right through the heart of a giant aquarium full of sharks. If you want to learn more about the sharks at The Nugget you can get a professional biologist tour (website) of their 200,000-gallon shark aquarium.  You will learn what the sharks eat, how the feeding process works, and you even get to take home a real souvenir shark tooth!   Tickets for the tours are $50 per person and run Wednesdays and Sundays at 1:30pm. The Golden Nugget has also frequently been featured in pop culture including being the home of the World Series of Poker.  The casino was even featured in the Elvis Presley film Viva Las Vegas (1964) & the James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever (1971).</p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Binion’s Gambling Hall:\n        <p>Texas cowboy Benny Binion opened this Casino in 1951 in an effort to class up the neighborhood.  Although it seems outdated now, in its heyday the casino was considered the poshest place to be and forced all the surrounding joints to upgrade.  Binions innovated in other ways than just style when they helped the World Series of Poker get off the ground by frequently hosting it at the casino.  This move into televised poker earned Binion’s Gambling Hall (formerly Binion’s Horseshoe) the nickname “The Place That Made Poker Famous”. </p>\n        <p>Binions is also home of the Million Dollar Photo which is the best photo op in Las Vegas!!  In the Casino’s Player’s Club, you can have your photo taken with the Binions girls and a stack of ONE MILLION DOLLARS in cash!  The huge pile of money is made up of 34,400 $20 bills and 42,000 $1 bills.  The Million Dollar Photo has actually been an attraction at the casino going back to the 1950s and from 1964-1998 the stack was made up of 100 $10,000 bills.  Although the photo opt is free, you are only allowed to go to the Player’s Club if you are 21+ and it is open from 9am-11:30pm. </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Fremont Casino:\n        <p>This was one of casino mogul Sam Boyd’s first properties and has some of the best food and drink deals around.  When it opened in 1956 over the site of the former Masonic Temple Opera House (1908-1912), the Fremont Casino was the tallest building in Nevada.  In 1959 Wayne Newton got his start in Las Vegas at the Fremont in its Carnival Lounge.  This was also one of four casinos (the only one Downtown) run by Frank Rosenthal for the mob from Chicago in the 1970s.  Rosenthal’s notorious career (1968-1982) in Vegas inspired Martin Scorsese’s famous 1995 movie Casino starring Robert De Niro.  Tourists and locals both love the amazing drink specials at the Fremont Casino’s bars including $1.99 Margaritas.  The food specials are awesome too with a $15.99 prime rib dinner served with a baked potato and buffet on Sunday, Monday, and Thursdays from 4-10pm.  On Wednesdays and Saturdays, they have the same amazing deal but with steak instead of prime rib.  If you are looking for accommodations the Fremont Casino has very nice rooms starting under $40 a night when booked online and more basic rooms as low as $29 a night.  </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Four Queens Casino\n        <p> Opened in 1966, The Four Queens is named after the builder Ben Goffstein’s four daughters.  The Spirit of The King Elvis Show at 9pm and the neighboring has magician show at 7pm are both pretty good.  The shows are inside the Canyon Club on Tuesday through Sunday, closed Mondays.  In front of the Four Queens Casino is the main stage for the free Downtown Rocks concert series from May through September each year run by the Fremont Experience.  The hotel isn’t the nicest, but they have clean basic rooms as low as $23 on weekdays and $48 on weekends.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>The “D” Casino\n        <p>This property was formerly called Fitzgerald’s Casino which was considered to be one of the luckiest casinos in Vegas.  Fitzgerald’s was Irish themed with shamrocks and a leprechaun.  Keeping the charm alive, The D Casino even has a large stone from Blarney Castle in Ireland on display which you can kiss for good luck.  Maybe the coolest gambling here is the oval multi-player Sigma Derby slot machine which is a vintage horse racing game that is fun even if you don’t win.  If you are considering staying on Fremont during your visit, The D is the nicest place to stay in Downtown Las Vegas by a mile.  The modern hotel rooms are posh and very hip yet still offers an excellent value even though it is a little more to stay here than the other basic hotels Downtown.  Even if you aren’t staying at The D, very we love their Long Bar (it’s very long) and the VUE Bar where you are able to go upstairs and get great views of Fremont Street.  In case you were wondering the name D stands for Downtown, Derek (the owner is Derek Stevens), and Detriot (Derek‘s hometown). </p>\n      </li>\n      <li>Slotzilla Zip Line\n        <p>Ever ride a zip line in the middle of a city?  At Slotzilla you have the opportunity to zip above the crowds from a 12 story tall slot machine and glide into the canopy of the Fremont Street Experience.  If regular zip lining isn’t enough, you can also zoom line in a Superman position!  The ride is a third of a mile and starts 114 feet off the ground.  Hours: Sunday-Thursday Noon-Midnight; Friday-Saturday Noon-2am.  Cost: $25 for zip line; $45 for zoom line on Weekdays or $49 on Friday & Saturday.  They often have discounts before 6pm and for repeat trips.  Address: 425 Fremont St; next to Walgreen’s.    </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Heart Attack Grill\n        <p> The main attraction of the Neonopolis Mall is the highly entertaining Heart Attack Grill.  Known for their greasy food and costumed nurse waitresses that will spank you in front of the other guests if you don’t finish your meal, the Heart Attack Grill is truly unique.  Claiming to be fighting anorexia since 2005, you eat for free if you are over 350 pounds and the restaurant’s spokesman really did die of a heart attack.  The milkshakes are very rich at the Heart Attack Grill and all of the food is cooked in lard.  Their Quadruple Bypass Burger was ranked by the Guinness Book of World Records for having the most calories in a burger with 9983.  Since then, the Heart Attack Grill has gone even bigger with the Octuplet Burger.  This monster has 8 patties (4 pounds of meat) between layers of chili and 40 pieces of bacon.  If you can eat the entire Octuplet Burger you get paraded out by the nurses in a wheelchair when you leave, but if you fail to finish you get spanked on the butt with a paddle.  Putting the Heart Attack Grill’s hospital theme over the are jello shots served in syringes and wine dripped from hanging bags like they are IVs.  They even give your entire group hospital gowns to wear while you eat.  While the Heart Attack Grill may be the least healthy restaurant you will ever visit, remember that you are in Sin City, a place where being a gluten and overindulging are fully acceptable.  We heard the calories you eat in Vegas stay in Vegas…</p>\n        <p>Also part of the Neonopolis Mall, we really love the axe, knife, and spear throwing at Ax Hole Fairly new to the mall is the thrilling Fear the Walking Dead Experience which is part maze and part interactive game.  The shopping at Neonopolis Mall isn’t anything special, but there are two really good Premium Outlet Malls in Las Vegas with many high-end shops you won’t find in most outlet malls.  One is nearby and connected to Downtown by bus and the other is near the bus depot on the way to the airport.  There is also a really famous World’s Largest Souvenir Shop just to the south of here at the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Sahara Ave, </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Fremont East District\n        <p>This far eastern end of Fremont Street is a great place to see what the original Downtown Las Vegas area looked like more than 50 years ago.  While the other end of street saw its businesses grow into tall towers in the 1950s then covers with the LED canopy in 1995, Fremont East is like an untouched time capsule. </p>\n        <p>Many visitors in search of the real Old Vegas like to gamble at Fremont East’s El Cortez Casino which was built in 1941 and is one of the only properties that hasn’t had a significant renovation since 1952.  New York mobster Bugsy Siegel bought El Cortez in 1945, but the city refused him an expansion permit because of his ties to organized crime.  This denial led to Siegel (murdered in 1947) investing in the development of the Flamingo Casino on the Las Vegas Strip which is outside the city limits.  The move also let the mobster know that Downtown Las Vegas wanted to be a little more respectable. </p>\n        <p>We love the cluster of vintage neon signs in Fremont East.  These historic neon signs include a retro Vegas sign, Oscar’s Martini Glass, the Hacienda Horse and Rider, the Red Slipper, a Showgirl, and a 30-foot-tall can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.  A majority of the signs were originally built by built by Yesco (Young Electric Sign Company, a famous Vegas sign-making company) and you can see a ton more at the Neon Museum & Boneyard later on this Downtown Las Vegas walking tour.  </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <h3>Other Sights Near Fremont Street: </h3>\n      <li>Atomic Liquors Bar\n        <p> Four blocks further down Fremont Street from the Heart Attack Grill is the Atomic Liquors Bar, the oldest freestanding bar in Las Vegas.  Joe and Stella Sobchik had started Virginia’s Cafe here during WW1 in 1945, then saw their opportunity to become a tourist attraction as Vegas was booming thanks to nearby nuclear testing.  In the 1950s there were total there were 100 above-ground nuclear tests (828 more underground) just 65 miles away from Las Vegas in Yucca Flats.  After getting their tavern license in 1952, Atomic Liquors Bar began having rooftop mushroom cloud viewing parties.  Not yet knowing the dangers of nuclear fallout and radiation, these viewing parties in the 1950s were huge hits and gave Atomic Liquors fame that has lasted the test of time.  In its heyday, Atomic Liquors had a local clientele bolstered by regular visits from celebrities looking to avoid the attention they attracted on the Strip or Downtown Las Vegas.  The likes of the Rat Pack, Barbara Streisand, the Smothers Brothers, Clint Eastwood and other notable characters could be seen enjoying their favorite beverage and playing a friendly game of pool after their shows or productions.  In pop-cultural, Atomic Liquors has been featured in The Twilight Zone as well as the movies Casino and The Hangover.  We can’t get enough of Atomic Liquors’ atmosphere, signature cocktails, crisp craft beers, and outdoor beer garden-style patio.  Bar Hours: Sunday-Wednesday 4pm-2am; Thursday 2pm-3am; Friday 2pm-4am; Saturday 12pm-4am; Sunday 12pm-2am.    </p>\n\n      </li>\n      <li>Gold & Silver Pawn Shop\n        <p>The most famous pawn shop in Las Vegas became a pop culture icon thanks to the History Channel show Pawn Stars.  We have also added markers to our Downtown Las Vegas walking tour map for two other History Channel show locations you can visit; Rick’s Restorations and Counts Customs.  Address: 713 Las Vegas Boulevard South.   </p>\n        <img src="'+a()(i)+'" alt="">\n      </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n';t.default=r},"Components/gambling/gamblingStrat/blackJackStrat/blackJackStrat.html":function(e,t,n){n.r(t);var o=n(14385),a=n.n(o),s=new URL(n(13288),n.b),i=new URL(n(33126),n.b),r=new URL(n(34476),n.b),l=new URL(n(16297),n.b),h='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+a()(s)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n    <div class="single-wide">\n      <h1>BLACKJACK STRATEGIES </h1>\n      <img class="img" src="http://gamblingplex.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/blackjack_game2.jpg" alt="">\n      <p>The game of blackjack is one of the most popular casino betting games. What is it exactly that makes this game so popular worldwide?  One of the main reasons that so many people love blackjack is because when played with proper basic strategy, Blackjack has a house advantage of less than one percent. This means that if you utilize a few basic tricks and strategies you can partake in a highly profitable gambling experience-have fun and walk away at the end of your game with more money than you came with.  Unlike other casino games such as slots and Roulette, which are based purely on luck, in the game of blackjack a player\'s chances of winning depend largely on the decisions that the player make. Taking the dealer\'s face-up card into consideration, a player can decide whether to take more cards, stay, split, or double down. This makes the game attractive to gamblers looking to make a profit.  Blackjack is exciting for players because of the social aspect. Players crowd around live blackjack tables to play together and root each other on. With great odds and a variety of gaming options, it\'s no surprise that blackjack is such a popular game to play.</p>\n      <h3>PROGRESSIVE BETTING STRATEGY FOR BLACKJACK  </h3>\n      <div class="flex">\n        <img class="pokerImg" src="'+a()(i)+'" alt="">\n        <p>Blackjack is a fun game to play and has a very low house advantage when played using the correct basic strategy.  We have provided you with the basic strategy charts (see below).  We also like to implement a progressive betting strategy while playing Blackjack.  The house still has a slight advantage over the player, but we find that by using this progressive strategy, you can increase your enjoyment of the game and potentially have a large winning session.  Using this system does does not give us an advantage over the casino, but it does get us to increase our wagers on a winning streak and potentially allow us to have a large winning session while only increasing our wagers with our winnings.  We like to play this progressive strategy because it makes the game more fun and exciting and really, isn’t that why we gamble.  If you normally play $5 a hand or $15 a hand, this strategy can increase your excitement and possibly help you have a sizable winning session at the casino.  </p>\n      </div>\n      <p>If you are normally a $5 a hand BJ player, consider using this strategy.  Buy in for $60 and ask for $10 in ones (white chips).  Start at $6 a hand and always go back to the $6 starting hand after any loss.  If you win the hand, increase to $10, if you win then increase to $16, then $25, $40, $60, $100.   Once you get to $100 a hand, wow you are doing great.  That’s 7 hands in a row!!! Fantastic.  If you had simply bet those 7 hands at your normal $5 a hand you would have won $35.  But with this progressive strategy you are now up $159.  It is difficult to win 7 hands in a row, but you are only increasing your wagers after a win, so all the increased wagers are your winnings.  if you win two hands in a row, you will have a $16 wager, but your original $6 bet has been returned to your starting pile of chips.  If you lose that hand, you have simply lost your profit, and start again at $6.  Hopefully at some point you get that 7 hand winning streak and really have a great winning session.  Now, if you are not comfortable wagering say more than $25 a hand, well that is fine, just build it up to $25 and wager it until you lose.  You may be surprised at how much more exciting the game becomes when you have a tower of chips.  It should be noted that after winning the $100 hand, some continue to bet $100 a hand until a loss occurs, others walk away with their pile of winnings.  We suggest taking a break after getting up to the max bet level.  You have accomplished your goal.  The system worked.  Take a break from the game and think about how lucky you were to subscribe to the VDF.  The same strategy can be used starting with $15 a hand.  You always go back to your original starting amount after any loss.  This way, you are only increasing your wagers when it is with your winnings.  We think you will find the game much more exciting, by playing this progressive system.  Here is a chart of the betting progressive system for both starting amounts. </p>\n      <h3>Progressive Strategy betting chart utilizing the Basic Strategy Card </h3>\n      <img src="'+a()(r)+'" alt="">\n      <p>$6, 10,16, 25, 40, 60,100\n        $15 table starting wager\n        $15, 25, 40, 60, 100, 140, 200\n        Remember always return to the starting amount after any loss. </p>\n      <p> If you push(tie) a hand, remain at that same betting amount for the next hand. </p>\n      <h3>EASY CARD COUNTING  </h3>\n      <p>If you’re interested in learning card counting but aren’t sure you want to learn a complex system right away, the Ace-Five Count might be just right for you. A perfect stratagy for newer to casual players that simply want to futher minimize the house edge and have the possibility of ending up with a slight advantage over the casino. Not the strategies players who play blackjack for a living or if your trying to maximize the player advantage over the casino. It also has the advantage of being very unlikely to out you as a card counter, since you won’t be playing at a huge advantage, and you won’t be adjusting your play very much. The Ace-Five Count is self explanatory because it only counts aces and fives. This makes the counting process for the player much easier and simplified. With the Ave-Five strategy players don\'t have to track the majority of the cards in the deck, just the Ace\'s and five\'s. This typically works because aces are the best card in the deck for the player, while fives are the worst. Aces mean that the player is more likely to make a 3-2 paying blackjack, while fives turn the normally bad dealer hands (12-16) into hands the dealer can stay on. Because there are an equal number of aces and fives in the deck or shoe to begin, no weighting or other adjustments are necessary. The player only needs to add one to the count (+1) each time a five comes out of the shoe, and subtract one (-1) each time an ace comes out of the shoe. When the count is positive, the remaining shoe is generally good for the player, while a negative count shoe is bad for the player.  </p>\n      <p>Play: Sit down at the start of the shoe, start your count at 0, and make a small bet, start with the table’s minimum bet. If the count grows to +2, double your bet. If the count gets to +3 or higher, double your bet again.  The amount of times you continue doubling after this point is completely up to the player. We usually stop after 2nd round. There are two forces working against you when continually doubling your bets when your count is +3 or greater. You are putting a lot of money at risk with only a small edge, meaning that your variance will be much, much greater. Large spreads can also increase the chances of getting noticed for card counting.  By using the Ace Five strategy you will likely hold a small edge of less the 1% against the casino. That’s usually enough advatage for you to come out ahead of the casino over the long haul. Its make you feel like you’re playing a game where you have some extra control and a slight advantage. It’s simply a great way to get started with card counting for beginner to casual play.</p>\n      <img src="'+a()(l)+'" alt="">\n      <h5>“Another mistaken gambling notion connected with the law of nunbers is the idea that an event is more or less likely to occur because it has or has not happened recently. The idea that the odds of an event with a fixed probability increase or decrease depending on recent occurrences of the event is called the gambler\'s fallacy. For example, if Kerrich landed, say, 44 heads in the first 100 tosses, the coin would not develop a bias towards the tails in order to catch up! That\'s what is at the root of such ideas as "her luck has run out" and "He is due." That does not happen. For what it\'s worth, a good streak doesn\'t jinx you, and a bad one, unfortunately , does not mean better luck is in store.” </h4>\n      <h6>― Leonard Mlodinow, The Drunkard\'s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives I’m We </h5>\n      <h3>Blackjack No No\'s </h3>\n      <p>Although Blackjack is one of the best games to play in the casino there are several variations where the casino advantage is much greater. Almost all of the bonus bets in Blackjack have a horrible house advantage.  These bets generally require an additional side bet next to your original bet in the betting circle.  VDF always recommends avoiding any of these side bets, as the house advantage is far too large. </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n';t.default=h},"Components/gambling/gamblingStrat/crapsStrat/crapsStrat.html":function(e,t,n){n.r(t);var o=n(14385),a=n.n(o),s=new URL(n(13288),n.b),i=new URL(n(97819),n.b),r=new URL(n(79744),n.b),l=new URL(n(79104),n.b),h=new URL(n(57977),n.b),d='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+a()(s)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n    <div class="single-wide">\n      <h1>Craps Strategy </h1>\n      <img src="'+a()(i)+"\" alt=\"\">\n      <p>When it comes to advatages, the house always wins in casino games. This is the main way the casino makes money. In craps the house edge can be very low or very high if not played properly. The winning % at Craps can be improved if you know the best way to place bets. Some bad craps bets can have up to a 14% house advantage. This means if you play craps improperly without learning any craps strategy you can lose a lot of money Fast. </p>\n      <p>By taking the time reading up our Craps strategy you’ll definately minimize your losses and hopefully maximize your chance of winning at craps. This happens by sticking to lucrative bets with a very low house advantage.  By eliminating the costly bets that so many make and focus on the right bets you will improve your chances dramaticlly over the long run. So let’s learn how to win at craps. </p>\n      <p><b>The best Craps bets to make are the Pass Line with odds or the don't pass line with odds. </b>These bets have the lowest house advantage of almost any game in the casino.  After making a pass line bet, you want to place odds after a point has been established.  These odds bets pay the true odds of the number being rolled.  The house has no advantage on the pass line odds (or don't pass odds), they are often called true or free odds because this is a bet that the casino does not have an advantage on.  The reason to play craps is to take advantage of this odds bet.  We suggest always taking at least 2x odds on your pass line bet (or Don't pass bet).  At the start of a new roll, make a bet on the Pass Line (or Don't pass Line) by simply placing a chip in the area directly in front of you.  Once a point has be established, place your odds wager directly behind your Pass line bet. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, the Pass Line bet and Don’t Pass Line bets are the best bets because of the low house advantage (only 1.41%).  </p>\n      <p>“Betting Against the Line” (Don't Pass Line) means you are betting with the casino. Hoping that a seven is rolled before the point number. These odds are actually slightly better than Pass Line bet as the house only has a 1.40% edge. You win by laying the person rolling and hoping that he hits a 7 before his Point. Be careful however when placing this bet as you are now betting against everyone else at the table i.e. when you win they all lose their bets. </p>\n      <p>The second range of optimal betting includes place 6, place 8, and buy 4 and buy 10. Buying the 4 and 10 is cheaper than placing them. Just remember that placing the other numbers is cheaper than buying them.  These are the only bets we suggest making in the game of craps.  All other wagers have a house advantage that is just too large for optimal play. </p>\n      <img src=\""+a()(r)+'" alt="">\n      <h3>Avoid making any of these bets on the craps table </h3>\n

</i></p>\n      <p>Now that you’ve seen the worst (hopefully) you won’t be tempted to make these wagers. </p>\n      <p>Remember, It’s best to stay with the craps basics: pass, don’t pass, come, don’t come, and odds.  </p>\n      <img class="img" src="'+a()(l)+'" alt="">\n      <h6>Setting and controlling the dice to improve outcome </h6>\n      <p>The question is, can the dice be manipulated and thrown in a certain manner to produce a regularly controlled throw? Some once-skeptical researchers are conceding that more testing is needed. For new dice players, just rolling the dice can be a bit daunting, but once you get the hang of it, it\'s easy. By throwing the dice in the same manner, each time, some shooters get into a rhythm that produces monstrous rolls.   </p>\n      <h4> The Sevens to Rolls Ratio   </h4>\n      <p>There are 36 combinations that can be made from of a pair of dice and six ways to attain a seven. This means that, with a random roll, the mathematical probability of a seven appearing will be once in every six rolls, which is a "Sevens to Rolls Ratio (SRR)" of 6. The house edge is calculated with this ratio.  If you throw the dice 42 times and roll seven 7\'s, you have a Sevens to Rolls Ratio of 6 (42/7 = 6). If, however, you have one non-random roll and throw seven 7s in 43 rolls, you have an SRR of 6.14. This is enough to negate the house edge on the 6 and 8 place bets. Just one controlled throw out of every 43 rolls of the dice would eliminate the house edge and yield a break-even game. </p>\n      <h4>How to Control the Dice   </h4>\n      <p> Controlled throwing consists of several components. How you set the dice can affect their outcome. One of the most popular sets is the 3-Vm where you have threes in a "V" formation. This gives you the hard six (3 and 3) on top, the six, (5 and 1) on the front, the eight on one (6 and 2) on the back and the Hard eight (4 and 4) on the bottom. There are no sevens showing on the dice with this set.  After setting the dice you must use a smooth delivery that is strong enough to get the dice to the end of the table but without too much force that will cause them to bounce hard against the back of the table. You also want to make sure that you follow through with your throw. You want to practice so you are throwing the dice the same way each time. Your goal is to throw numbers while avoiding the seven. Throwing the same way can produce repeating numbers. </p>\n      <h4>Practice Makes Perfect   </h4>\n      <p>For those interested in learning more about dice control, The Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution by Frank Scoblete and Dominator and Wong on Dice by Stanford Wong. These books can teach you the basics but the rest depends on how much effort you put into practicing. The controlled throwing of dice is a physical skill which requires hours of practice to master. It is not easy and some players never master it. Perfecting a controlled throw is not enough to guarantee regular wins at the craps table. You will also need to learn how to bet properly to take advantage of your edge.</p>\n      <img src="'+a()(h)+"\" alt=\"\">\n      <h6>Dice Consistency 101 - a few tips for beginners</h6>\n      <p>I believe it more accurately describes the goal than either Dice Control or Dice Influence </p>\n      <p> Here's a few tips you can use to start seeing a little difference in your dice rolling: </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Learn Dice Setting and choose one starting set to begin with, such as the 3,3  Flying V Starting setup (see pic). </li>\n        <li> This is a good set for visual feedback</li>\n        <li>Keep the dice square on the table, parallel to, and facing the backwall  </li>\n        <li>Before tossing the dice, visually choose a spot a few inches from the backwall to land your dice on.  </li>\n        <li> From now on, you'll do everything you can to hit that spot as often as you can  </li>\n        <li>Gently toss the dice, as if trying to \"swish\" a basketball through a hoop. </li>\n        <li>When you're hand is 3/4 through the toss, spring open your hand - letting go of the dice </li>\n        <li>Make sure the dice are level in the air - not twisting around in weird directions </li>\n        <li>Spinning backward or forward is fine. Try to keep the dice looking as if they were glued together in the air </li>\n        <li>Observe how the dice land, react to the backwall, and how much they keep rolling after touching the backwall. </li>\n        <li>I say touching the backwall, because you don't want to slam the dice into those pyramids.  </li>\n        <li>Take a mental note of what the dice show when they come to a stop. </li>\n        <li>If you're noticing that the dice are now rolling a certain combination more often - you're on your way  </li>\n        <li>Keep in mind that if you roll a 6 twice in a row - it means little if one combination was 4+2 and the second one was 5+1. Just keep adjusting your throw to make sure the dice land softly on target, lightly touch the backwall, and comes to a complete stop as quickly as possible (no bouncing around all over the craps table). </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h5>“Another mistaken gambling notion connected with the law of munbers is the idea that an event is more or less likely to occur because it has or has not happened recently. The idea that the odds of an event with a fixed probability increase or decrease depending on recent occurrences of the event is called the gambler's fallacy. For example, if Kerrich landed, say, 44 heads in the first 100 tosses, the coin would not develop a bias towards the tails in order to catch up! That's what is at the root of such ideas as \"her luck has run out\" and \"He is due.\" That does not happen. For what it's worth, a good streak doesn't jinx you, and a bad one, unfortunately , does not mean better luck is in store.” </h5>\n      <h6>― Leonard Mlodinow, The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives </h6>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n";t.default=d},"Components/gambling/gamblingStrat/gamblingStrat/gamblingStrat.html":function(e,t,n){n.r(t);var o=n(14385),a=n.n(o),s=new URL(n(13288),n.b),i=new URL(n(69100),n.b),r='<template>\n  <div class="MainContainer">\n    <div class="TitleImg center">\n      <img src="'+a()(s)+'" alt="">\n    </div>\n    <div class="single-wide">\n      <h1>VDF Gambling Strategies </h1>\n      <p>Lets get serious and start thinking gaming strategy.

Some casino gambling games are easier to win than others, because the house edge is lower. Games like blackjack and video poker are games of skill where strategy counts, while other games are pure games of chance. </p>\n      <p><b>Picking the right casino game helps a player stretch their bankroll, </b>increasing one’s excitement and enjoyment while betting. Below is the house edge of the most popular casino games. The lowest house edge equals the right bet to choose. Many rules affect blackjack odds, so we use standard Blackjack where blackjack pays 3:2, doubling is allowed, the dealer stands on soft 17, and splitting to four hands is allowed. </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Single-Deck Blackjack: 0.50% </li>\n        <li>2-Deck Blackjack: 0.78% </li>\n        <li>6-Deck Blackjack: 0.91% </li>\n        <li>8-Deck Blackjack: 0.97%</li>\n        <li>Craps: Come/Pass Line Bet: 1.41% </li>\n        <li>Craps: Don’t Come/Don’t Pass Bet: 1.36%  </li>\n        <li>Single-Zero Roulette: 2.70% </li>\n        <li>Double-Zero Roulette: 5.26% </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h4>"A dollar picked up in the road is more satisfaction to us than the 99 which we had to work for, and the money won at Faro or in the stock market snuggles into our hearts in the same way." </h4>\n      <h5>- Mark Twain (1835-1910)  </h5>\n      <h3>How to Win at Casino Games </h3>\n      <p>Using time-tested betting strategies is the best way to win at casino games. knowing the mathematics of the game and basic game play is critical to using betting strategies. For instance, basic strategy in blackjack provides the player with the optimal play in each scenario. In other games, no strategy exists besides finding the best bets in the game and using a winning betting system to manage your bankroll. Avoid the trendy betting systems like the Martingale, but instead use bankroll management to assure you limit losses when the game doesn’t go your way and lock in winnings when you’re on a winning streak.  </p>\n      <h3>Gambling Tips to Win </h3>\n      <p>Do your research, because there are online casino tips for winning that you can follow to boost your chances of winning and lower your risk of ruin. Casinos have a house edge in most games, which you should consider the price of entertainment. The great thing about gambling is you have a chance to win back the price of admission and then some. The casino winning tips below should give you a start on your research.</p>\n      <p><b>Use Rewards and Bonuses:</b> Never turn down comps of any kind. Always accept bonus offers, player rewards, and other promotions. Nothing lowers the house edge more than free money, so never play without using sliding your slots card into the machine or without inputting a coupon code you have. </p>\n      <p><b>Choose a Win Goal:  </b>“Win goal” is a money management term. It means you set an amount at which you end your gaming session. If you’re win goal is $500 and you win $500, you immediately quit playing. If you’ve won $499, then it’s alright to keep playing. Setting a win goal helps you lock in winnings. </p>\n      <p><b>Set a Loss Limit: </b>“Loss limit” is another bankroll management term and is the opposite of a win goal. It means you set a minimum amount at which you stop playing. Loss limits keep a gambler from going on tilt, while assuring responsible play. Your loss limit might mean you either end the session or take a few minutes break before using more of your bankroll. </p>\n      <p><b>Avoid Uninformed Betting: </b>Learn the correct strategy for any game prior to playing the games.  The house advantage over the player is much higher against an uniformed gambler.  The house will always have the edge in casino gambling, but with correct you play, you can minimize that advantage to less than 2%.  If you combine correct strategy with matchplay and free play coupons, you can create an advantage over the casino for those wagers! </p>\n      <p><b>Folding in Poker Games: </b>Mastering the art of folding is important in games like Texas Hold’em, Three-Card Poker, and Let It Ride. Poker players tend to be brave souls. It’s natural to make a call or raise the bet, but some of the best hands you’ll play are those in which you choose to fold. In online poker games, bluffing is marginal, so learning when you should call or not is key. </p>\n      <h3>What Is a Strategy? </h3>\n      <p>A <a href="#/stats101">gambling strategy</a> is a course of action you decide on in advance. For example, a gambling strategy might be to learn how to play blackjack using perfect strategy by memorizing a basic strategy chart, and then testing yourself with an online basic strategy tutor. The second step in that strategy might be to learn how to count cards by reading a book on the subject, picking a methodology, and practicing at your kitchen table until you can count down an entire deck in 60 seconds or less. The next step in that strategy might be to set aside a bankroll large enough to withstand the effects of standard deviation and avoid going broke. Your final step would be to embark on your new career (or avocation) as a card counter. </p>\n      <p>But that’s not the only valid <a href="#/stats101">gambling strategy</a>. Your strategy might be to set aside $50 out of every paycheck to play the slots with. You make a single trip to a casino once a month with a bankroll of approximately $200. If you lose the $200, you quit for the session, and you return the following month to try it again. If you win $200 or more, you quit winners for the session, have some fun with your winnings, and return the next month with your new $200 bankroll that you’ve accumulated. </p>\n      <p>The first strategy (the blackjack strategy) is a positive expectation strategy, assuming you can develop the skills involved, and also assuming that you have the self-discipline to follow it. A positive expectation strategy is one which can expect to win money over a long enough period of time. In the short term, anything can happen, but in the long run, gamblers with a positive expectation strategy expect to win more than they lose. </p>\n      <p>The second strategy (the slot machine strategy) is a negative expectation strategy. Slot machines are a negative expectation game, and even reasonable money management tactics like the one outlined above won’t overcome the game’s built in mathematical disadvantage over the long run.  Is one strategy better than the other? </p>\n      <p>That depends on your goals as a gambler. If your goal is to earn a living gambling, then you’d want to stick with some kind of strategy and game where you can get a positive expectation. Blackjack, poker, video poker, and sports betting are all gambling games where you can get a positive expectation IF you acquire the necessary skillset. </p>\n      <p>On the other hand, if your goal is to entertain yourself and occasionally celebrate a big win, and you don’t mind spending the money for that entertainment, the slot machine strategy above would work fine for you. Almost all other gambling and casino games besides the ones I mentioned in the last paragraph are negative expectation games, so you cannot hope to get an edge when playing them. Games like roulette, slot machines, craps, and keno have a negative expectation, and anyone who plays them long enough will experience more losses than wins. </p>\n      <h3>Best Gambling Strategies </h3>\n      <p>Those are single tips for the most popular games, but readers might want more details. In the section below, we go over the best strategies for each popular game, including video slots and Texas Hold’em. Keep in mind that casino strategies which work in brick-and-mortar gaming establishments do not always apply to online and mobile casinos. Handy tips exist for each game, so each best strategy tip will help you walk out of the casino with a bigger bankroll than otherwise. </p>\n      <h3>Best Slots Strategy </h3>\n      <p>As a general rule, <a href="https://www.casinogamblingstrategy.org/slots/">slot machines have no strategy</a> element. Winning or losing is purely a matter of chance. Skill-based slots are legal in Las Vegas and Atlantic City now — and should become mainstream in a few years. Also, some progressive jackpots go so high that playing becomes a positive expectation game, though winning on a progressive slot machine is still a matter of pure chance. Avoid the zigzag method and other proposed slots systems, because slot machines have no betting system proven to win. </p>\n      <h3>Best Blackjack Strategy </h3>\n      <p>It is possible to get a slight mathematical edge over the casino by counting cards at Blackjack. A variety of card counting methods exist. Some are easy to learn and others are complicated, for the average player, keeping an accurate count is very difficult to do.  The easiest way to gain an advantage over the casino is to play a single hand of Blackjack with a matchplay coupon.  For example:  if you wager $25 with a $25 matchplay coupon at the BJ table, the house maintains it 51%-49% advantage, but if you win, you collect $50 on a $25 wager, giving the player an enormous 49% advantage over the house on that wager.  We recommend always wagering with a coupon and/or free play that gives the player the house advantage. This is simply the best mathematical way to gamble.  If you are a low roller but wish to play some blackjack, then we suggest you consider using our winning hand progressive strategy, which tries to minimize the loss while going for a big win.

The best advice available for playing Roulette is to only play at a table that offers single zero.  This simply means that there is only one green zero instead of two or three.  Picking the correct table is the best advice you can get when considering the game of Roulette.   </p>\n      <p>The first thing to remember in basic roulette strategy is that you want to reduce the house’s edge as much as possible. To do this, you must stay away from double zero roulette tables. Always stick to single zero tables. Why? Because the house edge is slightly less on a single zero table than on an American double zero table. It is easy to understand why. When you bet on a number, let’s say number 1, on a single zero table, you have 36 numbers going against you (2-36 and single zero), giving you a 36-1 chance of your number coming up. However, when you bet on number 1 an American roulette table with the double zero, you have 37 numbers going against you (2-36, single zero and double zero), which gives you a 37-1 chance of your number coming up. But both bets pay out the same odds of 35-1. In short, you would be crazy to play an American Roulette table with a double zero if you had the option to play on a European Roulette table with a single zero only. </p>\n      <p>So the basic strategy for playing roulette is simply to maximize your chances against the house.  </p>\n      <p>The only time VDF would suggest you play the game of roulette is with a matchplay coupon.  You must choose from the even money bets at Roulette when playing a matchplay.   These \'even money\' bets include betting on Even, Odd, Low (numbers 1 through 18), High (numbers 19 through 36), or Red or Black. All of these wagers pay out at 1 to 1.   With a matchplay coupon, you have a massive advantage over the house.  Simply play the exact amount of your matchplay coupon with the coupon on either red or black.  If the number comes in you will double your money, if the other color comes in (or green) you lose the amount you bet.  It really is that simple.  The house has a 2.7% advantage on a black/red bet on a single zero roulette table, but you will be paid 2 for 1 with a matchplay coupon.  This is a very easy, straight forward way to play a matchplay coupon with a massive advantage over the house.  </p>\n      <p>However, if you really want to play roulette, there is also a basic strategy you can employ once you decide to play at the European (single zero) Roulette table. There is nothing complicated about this method, nothing you have to really remember, which is why it is the ‘basic’ roulette strategy.  On any roulette table, there are two different kinds of bets that pay 2-1. You have the Dozens and you have the Columns. The Dozens are the first 12, second 12 and third 12 numbers on the table. The Columns are the first column of numbers, the second column of numbers and the third column of numbers on the inside of the roulette table. This basic strategy can be employed when betting on either of these selections.  The house has the advantage on all of these wagers and although these strategies might increase your time on the tables, we do not recommend using them. </p>\n      <p>The idea of this roulette basic strategy is to attempt to minimize your losses. So, place a bet of 1 unit on the first dozen (1-12) and 1 unit on the second dozen (13-24). So, if the ball lands on any number between 1 and 24, you win, and you make a profit of 1 unit, since the bet pays 2-1. If, however, the ball lands on a number between 25-36, or 0 (remember, never play on double zero to minimize your chances of beating the house), you lose. You can switch it around, betting on first dozen and third dozen, or second dozen and third dozen, as long as you keep your two bets on.  </p>\n      <p>This is far from a guarantee of winning. In fact, over a long period of time, your bankroll will start to whittle away due to the edge the house has. But you can gain short-term profits using this basic roulette strategy, as long as you do not deviate from it. What you must remember is that any betting system or strategy which claims to guarantee you a win at the game of roulette is not telling you the truth. Betting systems as designed to make your session more interesting, and give you short-term gains, but you cannot eliminate the house edge by using them – it is why casinos put the house edge in. As long as you remember that, you can take this basic strategy and tinker with it to create a betting strategy for roulette of your own. </p>\n      <img src="https://www.thesportingemporium.com/wp-content/uploads/roulette-wheel-s.jpg" alt="">\n      <h5>"My life experience has taught me nothing happens by chance.

Using the correct strategy charts and choosing the right video poker game can reduce the house advantage to between 0% and 3%, based on the payback schedule.  Video poker offers many options and versions of the game as well as many different pay schedules depending on the particular game, casino and location. Understanding these variables and knowing where the best machines are is half the battle. Playing correct strategy is always recommended.   Open this app and use the strategy chart when sitting at the Video Poker machine to insure that you are choosing the correct mathematical choice. </p>\n      <img src="'+a()(i)+'" alt="">\n      <p>On this page I\'ve devised what I believe to be the perfect strategy for playing Jacks or Better video poker. By using the charts on this page you can achieve a payout percentage of 99.54% at full pay video poker, which offers the possibility of the highest mathematical return. Please keep in mind that this strategy was created for full pay Jacks or Better games. Choosing a video poker machine with the highest payout is the place to start.  You want to look at the pay schedules and try to chose a game that pays 9 for a full house and 6 for a Flush.  This is often referred to as a 9-6 Payout.  This is one of the best percentage paying returns for the video poker player in any casino.  Again, here at VDF, we are trying to minimize the house advantage on every bet.  Playing a Video Poker machine with the best payout will increase your bankroll and time on the machine.   </p>\n      <div class="flex">\n        <div class="">\n          <b>Here is a full pay Jacks or Better pay table:</b>\n        </div>\n        <img src="'+a()(r)+'" alt="">\n      </div>\n      <p>The pay table above assumes you\'re betting five coins per hand.

Many casinos continue to elliminate some of the more liberal rules of the game giving them a bigger advantage. It all started when Casinos started hitting on soft 17. Now many casinos have stopped allowing surrender or re-splitting aces in shoe games. The biggest rule change that effects players was first rolled out on single deck games. These games pay players 6:5 on a blackjack, as opposed to 3:2. This means that a $10 blackjack would pay $12 instead of $15. Once the casinos realized their single deck games were being tolerated this 6:5 rule started migrating to double deck and other shoe games. </p>\n      <p>While some Las Vegas casinos rules on blackjack have really tightened these days, there are still several places where a good BJ game can be found.
