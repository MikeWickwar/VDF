One of the most important moves when coming to Vegas and looking to start creating your own deals is to get a players card and use it where & when you play.  Most casinos offers some type of Free give away just for signing up. This could be free play, match plays, free food, or other trinkets.  Getting a players card allows the casino to track your gambling which can in turn generate comps (free complimentary things, like food, shows, rooms and more).  You might also start to receive additional offers from the casino for rooms, food and more via the mail and e-mail.  This is the easiest way to take advantage of all of the casinos promotional offers like coupons and giveaways. You can sign up at the casinos players club, make it the first stop at every casino.  For a list of Casinos with great sign up promotions,  Join VDF today and start mapping out your assault on Vegas !\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <h4>#2 - Use Coupons:</h4>  At VDF we recommend utiziling every possible coupon offer available to you as a consumer.  Yes coupons in Vegas!! Buy one Get one free's, Casino Matchplay's, 1/2 Off Deals, Freebies and more. Many coupons are available from local guide books and directly from the casinos at check in.  Always use any gambling coupons that give you an advantage over the casino.  At VDF we purchase and use 2 specific coupon books every year and have for 15+ years. We strongly suggest you purchase these coupon books prior to your trip and take advantage of some truly amazing deals. These books are filled with great coupons, including everything you need to do the Fabulous VDF Fremont Street Coupon Run. (info available to our paid members.) Join VDF and save hundreds!!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <h4>#3 - Get complimentary drinks:</h4> Drinks are expensive in Vegas but they don't have to be. Casinos offer free drinks to customers who are gambling... or look like their gambling.  Simply put your players card and some money in a machine and order your cocktail.  We suggest playing near the cocktail station for quicker service and remember to always tip a minimum of one dollar per drink.  At VDF we recommend you not purchasing any drinks from the casino bars unless they are running a special, happy hour or just serve cheap drinks. Let VDF show you the Best Happy Hours on and off the Strip.  Be creative in where you purchase your drinks.  As a VDF Membership you have access to our best tips and techniques for getting free drinks with very little gambling involved. Join today and find out this and tons of other great techquies to save you money. Want drinks faster? Join VDF and let us show you how to drink quality Free beverages as fast as you want them.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <h4>#4 - Playing the percentages:</h4> Only play the games that offer the lowest Casino Advantage.
