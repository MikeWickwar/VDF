        <h4>#1 - Use Players Cards: </h4>VDF TIP: Always signup for and use casino players cards.(They are Free). One of the most important moves when coming to Vegas and looking to start creating your own deals is to get a players card and use it where & when you play.  Most casinos offers some type of Free give away just for signing up. This could be free play, match plays, free food, or other trinkets.  Getting a players card allows the casino to track your gambling which can in turn generate comps (free complimentary things, like food, shows, rooms and more).  You might also start to receive additional offers from the casino for rooms, food and more via the mail and e-mail.  This is the easiest way to take advantage of all of the casinos promotional offers like coupons and giveaways. You can sign up at the casinos players club, make it the first stop at every casino.  For a list of Casinos with great sign up promotions,  Join VDF today and start mapping out your assault on Vegas !

      <h4>#3 - Get complimentary drinks:</h4> Drinks are expensive in Vegas but they don't have to be. Casinos offer free drinks to customers who are gambling... or look like their gambling.  Simply put your players card and some money in a machine and order your cocktail.  We suggest playing near the cocktail station for quicker service and remember to always tip a minimum of one dollar per drink.  At VDF we recommend you not purchasing any drinks from the casino bars unless they are running a special, happy hour or just serve cheap drinks.
