        <h4>PRO TIP: Getting from the airport to your hotel</h4>
        <p>With so much excitement and energy where arriving in Vegas it can be easy to just jump in a cab and head to your hotel. But that's actually the worst option for transportation. For only $2 you can ride the WAX bus (depending on my departure point – more on this further down). As per the shuttles, which are frequent and operate through the night, they still provide a great & affordable option if you traveled solo or with just one other person; if I travel in group of 4 or 5 people a large Uber may be a cheaper option.  Besides the WAX bus, for one or two people the shuttle provides an affordable alternative to the ever-increasing taxi fares (with ever-increasing starting fixed rate, which is simply a rip-off – and of course the expectation of a large tip, not sure why to this date, unlike pretty much any other cab service in the rest of the world). These shuttles will take you to any main resort, even off the Strip, and they are very important for those not wanting to be ripped off by taxis the second they arrive in Las Vegas. Don't ride in taxis ever when in Vegas. </p>

        <h4>TIPS FOR FINDING THE CHEAPEST FLIGHTS TO LAS VEGAS</h4>
        <p>When flying to Las Vegas you will most likely be flying to McCarran International Airport (LAS). When you land, you're only 10 minutes away from The Strip.</p>
        <p>Because Las Vegas is the 19th busiest airport in the world, it's served by many domestic and international carriers. There can be more price competition which means flying to Vegas can be more affordable than other less-traveled destinations.</p>
