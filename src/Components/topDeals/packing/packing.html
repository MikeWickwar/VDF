      <h4>Pro Tip:</h4>
      <p>Packing a suitcase may seem like a straightforward task—but do it wrong, and you could end up losing valuables, paying overweight baggage fees, or cleaning up messy spills. That’s why it’s vital to learn how to pack a suitcase the smart way. </p>
      <p>Once you’ve laid out everything you need, start with the heaviest items first. You’ll want to put them toward the bottom of the suitcase when it’s standing (i.e., the side with the wheels) so it won’t be too top-heavy. Distribute heavier items evenly between both sides of the suitcase so it won’t be pulled off-balance when it’s standing. </p>
      <p>When packing shoes, don’t let any space go to waste: Fill them with socks, undergarments, or other small items. If they’re dirty, pack the shoes in a plastic bag or put a shower cap over the soles to protect the rest of your bag. </p>
      <p>Some travelers swear by rolling clothes; others prefer to fold. But the best way to pack a suitcase is often a mix of the two. Wrinkle-prone items tend to come out in better shape if you fold them, but tightly rolled clothes are easier to work into the little nooks and crannies around your bag. My own strategy is to put my shoes in the bottom half of my suitcase, fill the top half with rolled clothing, and then fold bulky items like sweatshirts or rain jackets and lay them on top of everything else. </p>
      <h4>Hoover Dam</h4>
      <p>The Hoover Dam is located in the desert and temperatures will usually be hotter than 100 degrees (F) in the summer. It was 90 degrees (F) on our last visit in late March. </p>
      <p>Bring plenty of drinking water with you, especially if you plan to drive and park on the Arizona side. You'll be walking uphill on the way back to your car. The walk across the dam is a half-mile, round trip. </p>
      <p>Wear sunscreen and sun hats on the dam. There will be little to no shade. </p>
      <p>I recommend bringing your own snacks and picnic. The cafe at Hoover Dam serves lunch, bottled water and cold treats as well. </p>
      <h4>POOL PARTY KEEP IT COVERED...AT FIRST</h4>
      <p>Getting to the pool party usually means walking in through a casino where Grandma's playing Wheel of Fortune slots or Grandpa is trying his luck at blackjack. All-day clubs require patrons to wear resort-appropriate dress when heading to or from the pool party. Men should wear board shorts and a collared resort-wear-type shirt such as a polo shirt or Hawaiian shirt. Some day clubs allow nice T-shirts if they don't have offensive print. Women should wear a swimsuit cover-up such as a sundress, a nice top and shorts or other modest attire that meets the establishment's general dress code. Once you're out in the pool area, you can strip down to your swimwear. </p>

      <h2>PACKING FOR VEGAS</h2>
      <p>So the time has come to pack for your big trip to Las Vegas. But what should I bring? Las Vegas is hot in the summer, warm in the Spring and Fall and cool in the winter. Its always best to check the weather forecast before you leave and pack accordingly. Using luggage that has wheels so you can easily transport is highly recommended. Overpacking for Las Vegas is very common. </p>
      <p>Packing in advance reduces your chances of forgetting something and allows you time to purchase stuff you still need.  Pack only what you need. Most people over pack. For the most part, casual clothes are worn morning, noon and even at night in Las Vegas ...although many like to really step up their game in the evening. Dressing up to hit the town. But for casual attire that means slacks (black, brown, blue or khaki); linen or cotton in the Spring and Summer, wool/wool blend or polyester for Fall/Winter. Skirts and tops for the women. Pack a shirt or blouse for each day or your trip  Include at least one nice dressy outfit (cocktail dress or a dinner jacket) for going to a gourmet restaurant or night club. This is Vegas so go for it!  </p>
      <p>Bring a pair of underwear and socks for each day. Pajamas or oversized T-shirts work great for sleeping. Placing rolled up socks and other soft clothing items inside shoes will save space and help the shoes keep their shape. </p>
      <p>Take two-three pairs of comfortable shoes: one regular pair, and a casual pair of sneakers for walking and something dressy. We can't emphasize enough the importance of having comfortable, well-broken in shoes! You'll be doing a lot of "strip crawling" shopping and walking through those giant hotels. In Las Vegas, you’ll walk quite a bit. Women frequently think they need more than two-three pairs of shoes and might bring a extra's depending how long your staying and what your doing. Flip Flops are also recommended for the pool. </p>
      <p>Day Clothes: sun dresses, shorts, T-shirts and tank tops are a must for daytime wear. And bring a hat or cap with a wide brim to shade the searing sun. Wear sneakers during the day is your best bet. </p>
      <p>It is always a good idea to pack a sweater or light jacket even though it is warm (or hot) outside. It can get cool after dark and the air conditioning inside some casinos can be chilly. (The temperature difference between outside and inside a casino can be 30 degrees ...and 70 degrees can feel like 50.) </p>
      <img class="img" src="../../../Images/vegasGrandPool.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Most hotels have swimming pools, so don’t forget to bring bathing suits and cover-ups especially during the heat of the summer.  Most pools are heated and open year round so don't be afraid to checkout the hot tub in November.  </p>
      <p>Sunglasses are a must when traveling to Vegas. So are bringing plenty of sunscreen and Chapstick. It is recommended to wear at least a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more. </p>
      <p>You might need such personal items as a blow dryer, travel iron (check to see if your hotel supplies them) or hair rollers. Fragile articles are accepted as checked baggage only at the customer's own risk. The better hotels supply lotions, shampoos and irons/ironing boards.  </p>
      <p>Purchase travel size cosmetics and health/beauty aids to save space. Put cosmetics, shoe polish, nail enamel, perfume, sunscreen and anything else that might spill, spurt, break, ooze and stain your clothing into re-sealable plastic bags, a leak-proof cosmetic bag or unbreakable containers. You’ll need deodorant, toothbrushes, tooth paste, a nail clipper and (men) shaving stuff. (There is a Walgreen's across from the Park MGM hotel on the South Strip if you forget something.) </p>
      <p>Don’t forget aspirin, Ibuprofen, Extra strength Tylenol (or some other pain killer), adhesive bandages (band-aids for bistered feet), lotion/facial mosisturizer for the dry weather ...maybe even a small first aid kit. If you get air sick easily, or on your first flight, take some sort of motion sickness drug such as Dramamine before you fly. This is a readily-obtained over-the-counter at a drug store. (Nothing will relieve motion sickness once it has started.) </p>
      <p>If you are traveling from overseas, you will need USA plug converter so you can charge your phone charger/camera battery charger. (An AC plug converter is needed by European/Asian travelers so they can use their electronic devices.) </p>
      <p>Packing an extra roomy, expandable travel bag is a good idea to put your souvenirs and purchases in. A couple of large plastic bags are useful for wet or dirty clothing. </p>
      <p>A "money belt" - the kind that has a small purse built into a belt - is a very handy thing in Las Vegas. It allows you to easily and safely access your funds while you are walking around. </p>
      <p>Never leave your luggage unattended. If you must leave the area where you have placed it, even for a moment, take your luggage with you. Never allow anyone that you do not know to “watch” your luggage for you and do not carry anything for someone that you do not know or watch a bag for someone that you do not know. </p>
      <p>Keep in mind that most airlines limit carry-on bag dimensions to 9x14x22 inches (45 linear inches.) It must be able to fit in the aircraft overhead rack or under your seat. You are allowed one carry-on and a laptop computer or brief case is considered carry-on. You also carry one personal item such as a backpack, purse or camera. (It is confusing why a brief case is considered "carry-on" while a hand bag or purse is not! But that's the rules.)</p>
      <p>You should always carry important travel documents (plane tickets, hotel paperwork and such) and valuable items in your carry-on luggage. It doesn’t hurt to have photocopies in your checked luggage in case the originals get lost. </p>
      <p>Be certain to carry a government issued ID (with a photo) such as a driver’s license ...a passport and birth certificate if coming from a foreign country. You will need to show it several times during your stay. </p>
      <p>Bring an ATM card for emergency withdrawals, a major credit card (VISA, Discover, American Express or MasterCard), and a couple of hundred in cash ...more if you plan on gambling a bit. </p>
      <p>You’ll need a camera, or course, and plenty of film. Do not put film in your checked bag as it will get damaged when X-rayed by machines that scan checked baggage. (The scanner at the gates is less powerful and won't hurt film.) You might also take extra camera batteries. Be aware that everything is more expensive if you have to buy it in Las Vegas. </p>
      <p>If you take medication, put it in your carry on bag so you will have it in case your checked luggage gets lost. (Not likely, but it does happen.) You might even pack a single change of clothes if you have room. Bring a pen and small notepad. </p>
      <p>Be sure to place your name, address and itinerary on (and in) all of your bags so the airlines can find you if it gets lost. Carry a list of phone numbers important to you. Tipping is a way of life in Vegas. Carry a supply of $1 bills for tips; you will need them on your trip from the airport to the hotel.) </p>

      <h4>Gambling at the Airport</h4>
      <p>As soon as you exit the plane in Vegas you will hear and see the sweet sounds of slot machines. But don't be fooled, the odds on these machines are some of the worst anywhere. With a captive audience they don't need to offer better payouts... and they don't. Have some self control and pass on sliding that $20 into the machines there. Wait till your at your hotel and throw $20 into a machine at the video poker bar. Enjoy some free drinks and unwind from your traveling. Plus you might just hit a Royal Flush </p>
      <h4>Pro Tip: COMFORTABLE SHOES ARE A MUST IN LAS VEGAS!  </h4>
      <p> With so much to see and do in such a short time, Las Vegas will put your feet to work! On average the regular person walks 10-12 miles a day in Vegas. Having your most comfortable sneakers or shoes is a must. Save the heels for the wild nights. Bring a few Band-Aids just in case of a blister or two.  </p>
      <h4>Vegas Nights </h4>
      <p>Another thing people forget about Vegas, is that the town completely transforms at night and so should your attire. Upscale clothing is required at many of the nicer restaurants in town. Many even require jackets for men so check with the restaurant before making reservations. Business casual clothing is acceptable for shows. Jeans are frowned upon when it comes to performances. Casinos themselves just have shirt and shoes requirements. Its Vegas so look your best and bring the sexy! </p>
      <h4>Night Club Dress Codes  </h4>
      <p>Men will want to dress to impress when it comes to Vegas nightclubs. Clothing on men is often looked over carefully before entrance is allowed into some of the hottest clubs. Men shouldn’t wear jeans, hats, T-shirts, sneakers, or any kind of athletic wear. Women can sometimes wear jeans, but it is better to wear dress pants, a skirt, or a dress. Women will also not be allowed in wearing sneakers or flip flops. Dress shoes are required for everyone. Women shouldn’t wear t-shirts either. A good rule of thumb when dressing for a night on the town is to dress to impress. If the bouncers at the door don’t like what you are wearing they will not let you in. </p>
      <h4>Taking the Bus to Las Vegas  </h4>
      <p>The third most popular way to get to Vegas is by bus. From within 500 miles this can be an affordable option. Typically its approx. $50 each way via bus but you don't have to drive. Always compare with the cost of flying to make sure the value is there. This option takes much longer then flying but can sometimes be very cost effective. Use the time to master your favorite casino game, catch up on your e-mail and gets lots of sleep before the Vegas party starts!  </p>
      <h4> Get excited for Vegas! </h4>
      <p>  For some fun and excitement before the trip checkout Chevy Chase in Vegas Vacation. (1997)                        In the fourth outing for the vacation franchise, the Griswolds have to survive Vegas fever when they go to Las Vegas for a fun family vacation. Tip: Don't learn any of Clarks gambling techniques. </p>
