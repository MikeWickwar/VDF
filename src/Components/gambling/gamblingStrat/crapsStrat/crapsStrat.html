      <h1>Craps Strategy </h1>
      <img src="../../../../Images/crapsThrow.jpeg" alt="">
      <p>When it comes to advatages, the house always wins in casino games. This is the main way the casino makes money. In craps the house edge can be very low or very high if not played properly. The winning % at Craps can be improved if you know the best way to place bets. Some bad craps bets can have up to a 14% house advantage. This means if you play craps improperly without learning any craps strategy you can lose a lot of money Fast. </p>
      <p>By taking the time reading up our Craps strategy you’ll definately minimize your losses and hopefully maximize your chance of winning at craps. This happens by sticking to lucrative bets with a very low house advantage.  By eliminating the costly bets that so many make and focus on the right bets you will improve your chances dramaticlly over the long run. So let’s learn how to win at craps. </p>
      <p><b>The best Craps bets to make are the Pass Line with odds or the don't pass line with odds. </b>These bets have the lowest house advantage of almost any game in the casino.  After making a pass line bet, you want to place odds after a point has been established.  These odds bets pay the true odds of the number being rolled.  The house has no advantage on the pass line odds (or don't pass odds), they are often called true or free odds because this is a bet that the casino does not have an advantage on.  The reason to play craps is to take advantage of this odds bet.  We suggest always taking at least 2x odds on your pass line bet (or Don't pass bet).  At the start of a new roll, make a bet on the Pass Line (or Don't pass Line) by simply placing a chip in the area directly in front of you.  Once a point has be established, place your odds wager directly behind your Pass line bet. Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, the Pass Line bet and Don’t Pass Line bets are the best bets because of the low house advantage (only 1.41%).  </p>
      <p>“Betting Against the Line” (Don't Pass Line) means you are betting with the casino. Hoping that a seven is rolled before the point number. These odds are actually slightly better than Pass Line bet as the house only has a 1.40% edge. You win by laying the person rolling and hoping that he hits a 7 before his Point. Be careful however when placing this bet as you are now betting against everyone else at the table i.e. when you win they all lose their bets. </p>
      <p>The second range of optimal betting includes place 6, place 8, and buy 4 and buy 10. Buying the 4 and 10 is cheaper than placing them. Just remember that placing the other numbers is cheaper than buying them.  These are the only bets we suggest making in the game of craps.  All other wagers have a house advantage that is just too large for optimal play. </p>

      <h6>Setting and controlling the dice to improve outcome </h6>
      <p>The question is, can the dice be manipulated and thrown in a certain manner to produce a regularly controlled throw? Some once-skeptical researchers are conceding that more testing is needed. For new dice players, just rolling the dice can be a bit daunting, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy. By throwing the dice in the same manner, each time, some shooters get into a rhythm that produces monstrous rolls.   </p>
      <h4> The Sevens to Rolls Ratio   </h4>
      <p>There are 36 combinations that can be made from of a pair of dice and six ways to attain a seven. This means that, with a random roll, the mathematical probability of a seven appearing will be once in every six rolls, which is a "Sevens to Rolls Ratio (SRR)" of 6. The house edge is calculated with this ratio.  If you throw the dice 42 times and roll seven 7's, you have a Sevens to Rolls Ratio of 6 (42/7 = 6). If, however, you have one non-random roll and throw seven 7s in 43 rolls, you have an SRR of 6.14. This is enough to negate the house edge on the 6 and 8 place bets. Just one controlled throw out of every 43 rolls of the dice would eliminate the house edge and yield a break-even game. </p>
      <h4>How to Control the Dice   </h4>
      <p> Controlled throwing consists of several components. How you set the dice can affect their outcome. One of the most popular sets is the 3-Vm where you have threes in a "V" formation. This gives you the hard six (3 and 3) on top, the six, (5 and 1) on the front, the eight on one (6 and 2) on the back and the Hard eight (4 and 4) on the bottom. There are no sevens showing on the dice with this set.  After setting the dice you must use a smooth delivery that is strong enough to get the dice to the end of the table but without too much force that will cause them to bounce hard against the back of the table. You also want to make sure that you follow through with your throw. You want to practice so you are throwing the dice the same way each time. Your goal is to throw numbers while avoiding the seven. Throwing the same way can produce repeating numbers. </p>
      <h4>Practice Makes Perfect   </h4>
      <p>For those interested in learning more about dice control, The Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution by Frank Scoblete and Dominator and Wong on Dice by Stanford Wong. These books can teach you the basics but the rest depends on how much effort you put into practicing. The controlled throwing of dice is a physical skill which requires hours of practice to master. It is not easy and some players never master it. Perfecting a controlled throw is not enough to guarantee regular wins at the craps table. You will also need to learn how to bet properly to take advantage of your edge.</p>

      <h6>Dice Consistency 101 - a few tips for beginners</h6>
      <p>I believe it more accurately describes the goal than either Dice Control or Dice Influence </p>
      <p> Here's a few tips you can use to start seeing a little difference in your dice rolling: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn Dice Setting and choose one starting set to begin with, such as the 3,3  Flying V Starting setup (see pic). </li>
        <li> This is a good set for visual feedback</li>
        <li>Keep the dice square on the table, parallel to, and facing the backwall  </li>
        <li>Before tossing the dice, visually choose a spot a few inches from the backwall to land your dice on.  </li>
        <li> From now on, you'll do everything you can to hit that spot as often as you can  </li>
        <li>Gently toss the dice, as if trying to "swish" a basketball through a hoop. </li>
        <li>When you're hand is 3/4 through the toss, spring open your hand - letting go of the dice </li>
        <li>Make sure the dice are level in the air - not twisting around in weird directions </li>
        <li>Spinning backward or forward is fine. Try to keep the dice looking as if they were glued together in the air </li>
        <li>Observe how the dice land, react to the backwall, and how much they keep rolling after touching the backwall. </li>
        <li>I say touching the backwall, because you don't want to slam the dice into those pyramids.  </li>
        <li>Take a mental note of what the dice show when they come to a stop. </li>
        <li>If you're noticing that the dice are now rolling a certain combination more often - you're on your way  </li>
        <li>Keep in mind that if you roll a 6 twice in a row - it means little if one combination was 4+2 and the second one was 5+1. Just keep adjusting your throw to make sure the dice land softly on target, lightly touch the backwall, and comes to a complete stop as quickly as possible (no bouncing around all over the craps table). </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>“Another mistaken gambling notion connected with the law of munbers is the idea that an event is more or less likely to occur because it has or has not happened recently. The idea that the odds of an event with a fixed probability increase or decrease depending on recent occurrences of the event is called the gambler's fallacy. For example, if Kerrich landed, say, 44 heads in the first 100 tosses, the coin would not develop a bias towards the tails in order to catch up! That's what is at the root of such ideas as "her luck has run out" and "He is due." That does not happen. For what it's worth, a good streak doesn't jinx you, and a bad one, unfortunately , does not mean better luck is in store.” </h5>
