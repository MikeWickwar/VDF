      <h1>Where to Play Blackjack on The Strip</h1>
      <img src="../../../../../Images/black-jack-strategien.jpg" alt="">
      <p>The quality of blackjack games in Las Vegas has declined over the past 10-15 years. Many casinos continue to elliminate some of the more liberal rules of the game giving them a bigger advantage. It all started when Casinos started hitting on soft 17. Now many casinos have stopped allowing surrender or re-splitting aces in shoe games. The biggest rule change that effects players was first rolled out on single deck games. These games pay players 6:5 on a blackjack, as opposed to 3:2. This means that a $10 blackjack would pay $12 instead of $15. Once the casinos realized their single deck games were being tolerated this 6:5 rule started migrating to double deck and other shoe games. </p>
      <p>While some Las Vegas casinos rules on blackjack have really tightened these days, there are still several places where a good BJ game can be found. You can even find these right on the Las Vegas Strip. VDF however found some of the best action located downtown on Fremont St. </p>
