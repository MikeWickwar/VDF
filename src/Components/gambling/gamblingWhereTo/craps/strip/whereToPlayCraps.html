        <p class="eighty"><b>VDF TOP PICK - Casino Royale  </b>A great place to play, especially for low-rollers. Not only may you come here for the cheap beers, but you’ll find $5 minimums and a rowdy, fun environment. During the day, you can find $3 craps (sometimes). Again, though, with 3/4/5 times odds. </p>
      </div>
      <p>The $5 craps tables are becoming a thing of the past, although our understanding is that you’ll still find them at the Luxor. The Excalibur had a $5 table as recently as November 2019. You can also find one $5 table each at Harrah’s and at Bally’s during the day sometimes, and at NY-NY up until 5 PMish. </p>
      <p><b>The Sahara Las Vegas Hotel and Casino  </b>had $5 craps when it was the SLS, (even at nights sometimes), however we haven’t been there since they re-branded as the Sahara. </p>
      <p><b>The Cromwell </b>- Although a $10 Minimum, The Cromwell offers 100X Odds on Craps – If you enjoy rolling the dice, you'll find generous 100X odds on craps (the only location offering these odds on the Strip)   </p>
