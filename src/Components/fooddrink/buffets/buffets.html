      <h2>Fremont Street Buffet Options</h2>
      <p>Downtown Vegas has three casinos that offer an all you can eat buffet.  These buffets are fairly inexpensive, but also noticeably less quality than most of the famous buffets on the strip.  VDF recommends the Main Street Station buffet combined with a 2 for 1 coupon from either the LVA or ACG. This is the best buffet and best value when combined with the 241 coupon. The buffets at the Fremont Hotel & Casino and the Golden Nugget Casino are relatively affordable too, but bear in mind that, unfortunately, at present no downtown buffet is really that great when compared to the offerings on the Vegas strip. </p>
      <div class="flex align">
        <p><a href="#/hotels/MainStreetStationCasinoBreweryHotel">Main Street Station</a> – ⭐️⭐️⭐️ -  Our top pick for Fremont Street buffets.  Always use a LVA or ACG 2 for 1 coupon to get the best deal. Breakfast $10 / Brunch $11-$15 / Dinner $14-$17.  </p>
        <img style="width: 100px;" class="img" src="../../../Images/TopPickChip.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p><a href="#/hotels/GoldenNugget">Golden Nugget</a> - ⭐️ - Below average buffet and average price for the area.  Breakfast $16 / Brunch $17-$23 / Dinner $24-$29 </p>
      <p><a href="#/hotels/Fremont">Fremont Hotel & Casino</a>- ⭐️ - Below average buffet even with the 2 for 1 coupon.  Breakfast $9-$13 / Brunch $10-$14 / Dinner $16-$26 </p>

      <h2>BETTER AFFORDABLE BUFFETS IN VEGAS</h2>
      <p>If you are staying downtown and you wish a bit of variety in terms of buffet choices, you can always hop onto the Deuce, which starts its route at one end of Fremont Street (very convenient!), close to El Cortez and go to the strip, almost all the strip buffets are better than the downtown Vegas buffets. However, if you have a car, your best cheap buffet options are without a doubt, the delicious, huge and very affordable <a href="https://top-buffet.com/vegas-m-buffet-studio-b-review/">Studio B</a>  at the beautiful M Resort (very affordable on weekdays), the super affordable yet good <a href="https://top-buffet.com/vegas-red-rock-all-you-can-eat-review/"> Red Rock Buffet </a>and our top pick: the <a href="https://top-buffet.com/vegas-palms-hotel-review/">Palms buffet</a> (when useing a 2 for 1 Coupon from the ACG). </p>
      <h2>OFF THE VEGAS STRIP BUFFETS AND THEIR COST </h2>
      <p>There are several very good and affordable buffets at the off the strip casinos.

    <h2>Try these tips: </h2>
    <h4>Use the 2 for 1 buffet Coupons </h4>
    <p>The American Casino Guide ACG and Las Vegas Advisor are packed with 2 for 1 Buffet deals.  A great buffet becomes even better at 1/2 price. That makes a $30 Dinner buffet only $15 each including non alcoholic drinks. VDF recommends always using the buffet 2 for 1 coupons for maximum savings on meals in Vegas! </p>
    <img style="width: 150px; heightL 150px;" class="" src="../../../Images/pokerchip2.png" alt="">
    <h4>TIMING IS EVERYHING </h4>
    <p>The pricing change and become more expensive from Breakfast to lunch and from Lunch to dinner. Arriving 10 Minutes before dinner starts allows you to pay for the lunch buffet but enjoy the dinner buffet. Usually the dinner buffet is 20-25% more then the lunch buffet. Want to make your our brunch? Show up 10 minutes before breakfast service is ending and stay through lunch.    </p>
