      <h4>HOOVER DAM</h4>
      <h5>What to Bring:</h5>
      <p>Hoover Dam is located in the desert and temperatures will usually be hotter than 100 degrees (F) in the summer. It was 90 degrees (F) on our last visit in early April </p>
      <p>Bring plenty of drinking water with you, especially if you plan to park in the free parking on the Arizona side. You'll be walking uphill on the way back to your car. The walk across the dam is a half-mile, round trip. </p>
      <p>Wear sunscreen and sun hats on the dam. There will be little shade. </p>
      <p>We recommend bringing your own snacks and picnic foods. The cafe at Hoover Dam serves lunch, bottled water and cold treats too. </p>

      <h2>TOURS & TRIPS</h2>
      <p>The Strip may be the heart of Las Vegas, but there’s so much more to Sin City than the casino resorts and bright lights of Las Vegas Boulevard.  </p>
      <p>With so many awesome places to see off the Strip its hard to pick one or two. Plus it’s just really difficult to rip yourself away from the casinos, bars and sights. The Grand Canyon, a helicopter tour and a visit to The Mob Museum are all super fun things to do.  </p>
      <p>If you have time (and energy!) to explore beyond the Strip, be sure to checkout everything Nevada has to offer. </p>
