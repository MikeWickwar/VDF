        <li>Beam Me Up The Luxor’s Sky Beam! </li>
        <p>As if the Great Sphinx of Giza and a 111meter high pyramid on the Strip weren’t enough, the Luxor Sky Beam at 42.3 billion candelas, is the strongest beam of light in the world! A must see…and hard to miss! </p>
        <li>Walk Like and Egyptian At The Luxor Hotel & Casino</li>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.vegasunzipped.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/luxor1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The pyramidal profile of the Luxor is a hell of a lot more than a Vegas “themed” hotel. Not only is the structure equal in size to two of the larger pyramids in Egypt, it’s modern interior design, high Green Key Eco rating, and 4000+ room capacity makes it one of the most unique and 8th largest hotel in the world. Go back in time to c. 2500 BC on the south end of the Strip! </p>
        <li>See Paris In Vegas </li>

        <p>The replica Eiffel Tower at Paris Hotel captures a certain je ne sais quoi, right on the Vegas Strip. Romance and intrigue await visitors that view this iconic landmark. While there is a fee to ascend this magnificent structure, gazing up at 50 stories of elegance and grace from street level is enchanting, especially at night when it’s lit from tip to footings. Viewing the tower from the pool is a great option. </p>

      <h4>Free Attractions</h4>
      <p>Most of these free attractions and activities are located on the Strip and are suitable for Vegas vacation with kids and teens.  We have also provided approximate times and schedule of free Las Vegas shows so you can easily plan your vacation! </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Luxor  3900 Las Vegas Blvd S </li>
        <p>Luxor is built in the shape of an ancient Egyptian pyramid - in particular, Pyramid of Khafre located in Giza in Egypt. As with Pyramid of Khafre, Luxor is guarded by a great Sphinx statue - although the Vegas version is newer, the resemblance is striking. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/xluxor-las-vegas-vs-real-pyramid-in-giza.jpg.pagespeed.ic._pYlmFcNY2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>If you happen to be passing by Luxor hotel at night, you will notice another interesting landmark - the Sky Beam. In fact, you will notice it from anywhere in Las Vegas - it's the brightest light beam not just in Vegas, but in the entire world!  Produced by a combined effort of energy-efficient 39 Xenon lamps that keep Luxor's electric bills just a bit higher than average, the Sky Beam is visible from 250 miles away!  </p>
        <li>MGM Grand 3799 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>
        <p>MGM Grand Hotel. If you happen to be passing by between 10 am - 8:30 pm and if the activity we are describing below sounds like fun to you - be sure to pop in!  </p>
        <p>MGM Grand is home to CBS Television City Research Center, where the notion of free Las Vegas shows gets an entirely new meaning. The Research Center is the place of where big decisions regarding the destiny of new TV shows are made. And guess who is helping to make the decisions? They rely heavily on tourists like you and me to watch shows, pilots and other TV programs and rate them honestly. </p>
        <p>The Center is located at the Studio Walk - MGM Grand's shopping center. Screenings change every 30 minutes or so, and the Research Center attracts just a modest crowd. </p>
        <p>When passing by MGM Grand, especially if you are with your kids, you could also drop by M&M World located nearby - it's a paradise for chocolate lovers, and is free to enter.  </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/xmms-world-las-vegas.jpg.pagespeed.ic.Jv3DqE0tDH.jpg" alt="">
        <li>New York New York Hotel & Casino 3790 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>
        <p>New York New York hotel is themed after New York City. Of course it would be impossible to recreate an entire city on such a small territory, so what they did was take the most famous NYC landmarks and throw them in together to create this masterpiece. </p>
        <p>There is plenty of free Las Vegas to see outside. Other than the obvious Statue of Liberty and NYC skyscrapers that are approximately 1/3 size of the original, we'd like to draw your attention to a few other landmarks featured at New York New York Hotel Las Vegas. </p>
        <p>Grand Central Terminal </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/newyork-hotel-las-vegas-vs-new-york-city-grand-central-terminal.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Brooklyn Bridge </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/newyork-hotel-las-vegas-vs-new-york-city-brooklyn-bridge.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Soldiers And Sailors Monument </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/newyork-hotel-las-vegas-vs-new-york-city-soldiers-and-sailors-monument.jpg" alt="">
        <li>CityCenter Waldorf Astoria Hotel, 3730 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>
        <p>CityCenter is an urban complex that consists of several beautiful, modern hotels that have one thing in common - a water and crystal theme.  </p>
        <p>We will briefly look at the hotels located inside CityCenter to notice the beautiful design. We'd like to draw your attention to many water features located outside of Aria Hotel. If you have the time, walk inside Aria, too - they have plenty of free artwork displayed everywhere. If art is your thing, you won't find any better free to see Las Vegas. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aria-fountains-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>As they say at Aria themselves, always look up - you might find something interesting there - for example, a silver replica of Colorado River installed in the lobby. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aria-lobby-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/art-gallery-dale-chihuly-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <li>Bellagio 3600 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>
        <p>  Bellagio Hotel And Casino. Bellagio offers five incredible, absolutely free Las Vegas attractions - Fiori Di Como - a glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly, the Dancing Fountains, Botanical Gardens, Cirque du Soleil Fine Art Gallery by Richard MacDonald, and Chocolate Fountain </p>
        <p>The first thing you notice when you come inside the lobby of Bellagio is a beautiful glass sculpture Fiori Di Como by renown sculptor Dale Chihuly. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/fiori-di-como-bellagio-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Fountains are located outside of the hotel, so you don't need to come in for the most incredible of all free Las Vegas shows. The Fountains run on schedule, from every 15 minutes to every 30 minutes during operating hours. Current hours is Monday - Friday from 3:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m, Saturdays and Sundays - from 12:00 p.m to 12:00 am. On Sundays, the show runs starting at 11:00 am. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/fountains-bellagio-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Another great free attraction located inside Bellagio is the Conservatory and Botanical gardens. This one can be viewed any time, as it's open 24/7. The Botanical Gardens are among "must-see" free Las Vegas attractions, even if you are not into "flowers"    </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/bellagio-conservatory-botanical-garden-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>If you have the time, check out the largest chocolate fountain in the world located inside Jean Philippe Patisserie. The fountain in free to watch, unlike chocolates in the Patisserie - umm, well, yum. </p>
        <li>Paris Hotel  3645 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>
        <p>Paris Hotel, there is no need to go inside as they don't run any actual free shows, but we will find plenty of free Las Vegas shows outside the hotel (unless you want to take a close look at the replica of Le Pont Alexandre III from Paris located inside the hotel.</p>
        <p>The hotel's main attraction - Eiffel Tower - is hard to miss. It's free to explore it from the outside, however, if you want to ride the elevator and check out the Strip from top of the Tower - it will cost you $7.50 to $22.00 or, will be free with Power Pass that grants access to multiple attractions and plenty of free Las Vegas shows and things to do. Eiffel Tower is almost exact replica of the real thing, except twice as small. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/paris-hotel-eifel-tower-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <li>Flamingo  3555 S. Las Vegas Blvd </li>
        <p>Flamingo Hotel - home to Flamingo Wildlife Habitat. Here are 3 reasons why. 1. You love flamingos, 2. You've never seen them, and 3. You have kids. Otherwise, you can do without it. </p>
        <p>In the habitat, flamingos simply walk around among hotel guests. Don't get us wrong, they are quite pretty, but if we are looking for free Las Vegas shows, we want more than just walking birds! </p>
        <li>Caesars Palace 3570 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>
        <p>Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino - the one you saw in the hit comedy "Hangover"! And if you are still wondering - no, Caesar never lived here. Although if he lived in the 21st century and wanted to have a palace, he would probably choose this place. There are plenty of free Las Vegas shows at Caesars Palace. </p>
        <p>The first thing you notice is Roman statues, including a reproduction of David by Michelangelo. Take your time and have a look around, if you like statues. But now you probably heard about moving statues at Caesars Palace which is among the most famous free Las Vegas shows. </p>
        <p>However, not all the statues here can move. To watch the show, you need to go to Forum Shops - a shopping center located inside Caesars Palace. The Fall of Atlantis show, using animatronic statues, runs every hour starting at 11:00 a.m. and until 11 p.m or 12 p.m. </p>
        <p>The show tells the story of a feud between a brother and a sister, who can't decide who will rule Atlantis. They fight using water and fire, gods interfere, and Atlantis falls...to rise again the next hour. I can't think of another city that falls and rises that often </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/fall-of-atlantis-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>As you are exploring the Forum Shops, notice the aquarium, located near the Fall Of Atlantis show. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aquarium-forum-shops-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Colosseum - It looks pretty much like the real Colosseum in Rome. This is the venue where sing Celine Dion, Rod Stewart and Elton John. </p>
        <li>The Mirage Hotel 3400 S. Las Vegas Blvd.  </li>
        <p>Mirage is known for the most "explosive" shows performed by a an artificial erupting Volcano installed in front of the hotel. The show runs every hour from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. nightly. </p>
        <p>The show is accompanied by music (I wish real volcanoes followed this example!). When it's not erupting, the Volcano turns into a peaceful waterfall. Again, a great example for all other volcanoes. As it's one of the most popular free Las Vegas shows, be sure to arrive in advance - it gets quite crowded her </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/mirge-volcano-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Saw the volcano? Don't leave yet! Pop inside the hotel to check out the tropical rainforest (atrium) of The Mirage. It really creates illusion of a mirage in the middle of a desert - very beautiful and smells so nice. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/atrium-mirage-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>And if you have kids, or love fish (or fishing!) and the aquarium at Forums Shops wasn't enough, check out the Aquarium inside the lobby of the Mirage. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/aquarium-mirage-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <li>The Venetian Hotel  Address: 3355 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>
        <p>As much as we love fish and rainforests, we need to move on - we have completely different free Las Vegas shows waiting for us at The Venetian Hotel, or, in particular, at the Grand Canal Shoppes. </p>
        <p>Here, we are going to watch a beautiful Italian themed production of Carnevale di Venezia, also known as Streetmosphere - incredibly beautiful free Las Vegas shows, where "Street" performers dressed in costumes of Italian Renaissance period, sing Italian songs and opera. </p>
        <p>They have a complex schedule, but performances start at 12:00 p.m. and last until 6:30 p.m. You can find performers at the St. Mark's Square or Barney's New York. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/streetmosphere-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Don't leave yet! Did you like statues at Caesars Palace? Well here at The Venetian they have something almost just as cool (or spooky - depends on how you look at it) - the living statues. These are actually people dressed as statues that move very little. A proof that in order to work at The Venetian you either need to sing or to move to stand still for hours. </p>
        <li>Fashion Show Mall 3200 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>
        <p>Fashion Mall - Ready for something new? Free fashion shows! Yep, that exists in Las Vegas - the city where dreams come true (provided you dream about free catwalk shows). </p>
        <p>To see this, you need to arrive at Fashion Show Mall on Friday, Saturday or Sunday between 12:00 p.m. and 6 p.m. The show runs every hour on the hour. </p>
        <li>Circus Circus Hotel  2880 S. Las Vegas Blvd.  </li>
        <p>So you can't afford Cirque du Soleil, but still want to see a circus show while in Las Vegas? </p>
        <p>Circus Circus hotel - where circus never stops! Be sure to arrive to the Midway located inside the hotel at 11:00 a.m. - because that's when the fun begins. </p>
        <p>Well let us tell you - it's not Cirque du Soleil, but these free Las Vegas shows are the next best thing. You will see acrobats, jugglers, clowns and pretty much everything that comes to mind when you think of a circus - except animals. </p>
        <li>Stratosphere  2000 S. Las Vegas Blvd. </li>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/circus-circus-shows-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Stratosphere. We have a something fun for you. We are going to watch people tumble down from the top of Stratosphere hotel! In case you want to jump - it will cost you $119.99 (see more thrilling things to do). But watching others scream with fear is absolutely free and might fill you with a fuzzy, warm feeling of safety and happiness that you are not there! </p>
        <p>You can catch people jumping any time between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 a.m., and on Friday and Saturday until 2:00 a.m. You can watch the jumps from the ground, or even on a big-screen TV in the SkyJump store. </p>
        <li>Fremont Street Experience 425 Fremont Street </li>
        <p>Now that we've seen all or nearly all free attractions on the Strip, we go to downtown for a taste of "old Vegas" - the Fremont Street Experience.</p>
        <p>Be sure to arrive any time between dawn and dusk to watch a grandiose show of light and sound on the large LED canopy installed on top of the Fremont Street Experience. The show of light called Viva Vision runs every hour on the hour and each show is about 6 minutes long. </p>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.lasvegas-entertainment-guide.com/image-files/fremont-street-experience-las-vegas.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Other than Viva Vision, Fremont Street Experience offers plenty of free Las Vegas shows, including daily live music concerts on 2 stages, played by various bands.  </p>
