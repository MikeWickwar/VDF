      <h2>European Style: Best Topless Pools in Las Vegas</h2>
      <p>Adults-only pools have been making a splash in Las Vegas for a few years now. And just like everything Las Vegas does, the European-style sun bathing experience doesn’t just offer a bunch of topless women laying poolside. While that in itself may sound like a perfect pool experience, Las Vegas’ European pools give you so much more. From exotic nightlife atmospheres to poolside massages and blackjack tables here are the best topless pools in Las Vegas: </p>
      <h4>Tao Beach at the <a href="#/hotels/TheVenetian">Venetian</a></h4>
      <p>By far one of the most popular pools in Las Vegas, Tao Beach just got hotter with the addition of European-style sunbathing every Monday through Wednesday. The topless addition is on top of an already exotic and sophisticated experience where daybeds, cabanas, and a 30-foot bar are just a small part of the sin you can experience here. </p>
      <h4>Venus at <a href="#/hotels/CaesarsPalace">Caesars Palace</a></h4>
      <p>More than just a topless, European sunbathing experience, Venus is Las Vegas nightlife at it’s finest. The nude sunbathers are almost an after thought to the live music, modern vibe and attentive service you’ll experience at this European-style pool. And to ensure your privacy, Venus does not allow cameras, or video recorders of any kind. Venus is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>
      <h4>Bare Pool Lounge at the <a href="#/hotels/TheMirage">Mirage</a></h4>
      <p>The name says it all. Bare Pool at the Mirage takes topless sunbathing to a whole new level. Guests will feel more like they’re enjoying a day at the spa then laying out in the hot Las Vegas sun. Thanks to towering palm trees that seclude the pool, bottle service, day beds, cabanas, two luxury dipping pools and plenty of pampering, Bare Pool is the way European sun-bathing should be. Bare Pool is open Thursday through Monday11 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>
      <h4>Moorea Beach Club at <a href="#/hotels/MandalayBay">Mandalay Bay  </a></h4>
      <p>Described as a “private, sophisticated European bathing experience,” Moorea Beach Club is located off the Beach at Mandalay Bay and is surrounded by frosted panes that offer a sense of privacy from the rest of Mandalay Bay’s pool goers. Cushioned chaise lounges, poolside massage services, personal attendants, days beds and pavilions make Moorea Beach Club one of the most topnotch topless European pools in Las Vegas. Moorea goes topless Friday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>
      <h4>European Pools at <a href="#/hotels/Wynn">Wynn</a>and <a href="#/hotels/EncoreatWynn">Encore</a></h4>
      <p>Both Wynn and Encore offer European-style pools for their hotel guests looking to relax in the warm Las Vegas sun. Encore’s topless pool has a bar in the center of it, just in case you need a drink or two before removing your top and Wynn’s has blackjack tables if you like betting in the buff! </p>
